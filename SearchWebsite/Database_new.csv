1,"Hypermobile EDS (hEDS, formerly categorized as type 3) is mainly characterized by hypermobility that affects both large and small joints. It may lead to frequent joint subluxations (partial dislocations) and dislocations. In general, people with this variant have skin that is soft, smooth, and velvety and bruises easily, and may have chronic muscle and/or bone pain.  It affects the skin less than other forms. It has no available genetic test.  hEDS is the most common of the 19 types of connective tissue disorders. Since no genetic test exists, providers have to diagnose hEDS based on what they already know about the condition and the physical attributes that the patient shows. Other than the general signs, attributes can include faulty connective tissues throughout the body, musculoskeletal issues, and family history. Along with these general signs and side effects, patients can have trouble healing.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes,hEDS,Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes Wikipedia
2,"Women who are pregnant should be warned about things such as pre-labor rupture of membranes, drop in blood pressure with anesthesia, precipitate birth (very fast, active labor), malposition of bleeding, and more. New mothers with hEDS should pay extra attention to taking care of their new babies. Mothers may have trouble taking care of the baby because of the risk of dropping the baby due to weak connective tissue in arms and legs, falling, postpartum depression (more than the general population), and healing from the birthing process.[14]

Genetics of Hypermobile EDS While 12 of the 13 subtypes of EDS have genetic variations that can be tested for by genetic testing, there is currently no known genetic cause of hEDS. Despite the unknown gene, hEDS appears to follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance[citation needed]. This means that in order to be affected, an individual only needs a mutation in one copy of the responsible (unknown) gene in each cell. This mutation can either be inherited from a parent or may be a de novo (new) mutation in the gene. An individual with hEDS has a 50% chance of passing their mutated gene onto their children.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes,hEDS,Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes Wikipedia
3,"Classical EDS (formerly categorized as type 1) is characterized by extremely elastic skin that is fragile and bruises easily; and hypermobility of the joints. Molluscoid pseudotumors (calcified hematomas that occur over pressure points) and spheroids (cysts that contain fat occurring over forearms and shins) also are seen often. A side complication of the hyperelasticity presented in many cases of EDS makes wounds closing on their own more difficult.[22] Sometimes, motor development is delayed and hypotonia occurs.[4] The variation causing this type of EDS is in the genes COL5A2, COL5A1, and less frequently COL1A1. It involves the skin more than hEDS.[23] In classical EDS, large variation in symptom presentation from patient to patient often is seen. Because of this variance, EDS has often been an underdiagnosed disorder.[24] Without genetic testing, healthcare professionals may be able to provide a provisional diagnosis based on careful examination of the mouth, skin, and bones, as well as through neurological assessments.[25] The hyperelasticity of skin in EDS patients can be difficult to use in diagnosis because no good standardized way to measure and assess the elasticity of the skin is known, but hyperelasticity is still a good indicator as something that may point towards EDS along with other symptoms.[citation needed]

A good way to begin the diagnosis process is looking at family history; EDS is an autosomal dominant condition, so is often inherited from family members.[22] Genetic testing remains the most reliable way for an EDS diagnosis to be made.[26] While no cure for type 1 EDS has been found, a course of non-weight-bearing exercising can help with muscular tension, which can help correct some of the symptoms of EDS. Anti-inflammatory drugs and lifestyle changes can help with joint pain. Lifestyle choices should also be made with children who have EDS to try to prevent wounds to the skin. Wearing protective garments can help with this. In a wound, deep stitches are often used and left in place for a longer period of time than normal.[22]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes,cEDS,Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes Wikipedia
4,"Vascular EDS (formerly categorized as type 4) is identified by skin that is thin, translucent, extremely fragile, and bruises easily. It is also characterized by fragile blood vessels and organs that can easily rupture. Affected people are frequently short, and have thin scalp hair. It also has characteristic facial features including large eyes, an undersized chin, sunken cheeks, a thin nose and lips, and ears without lobes.[27] Joint hypermobility is present, but generally confined to the small joints (fingers, toes). Other common features include club foot, tendon and/or muscle rupture, acrogeria (premature aging of the skin of the hands and feet), early-onset varicose veins, pneumothorax (collapse of a lung), the recession of the gums, and a decreased amount of fat under the skin.[4] It can be caused by the variations in the COL3A1 gene.[27] Rarely, COL1A1 variations can also cause it.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes,vEDS,Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes Wikipedia
5,"Joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (JHS/EDS-HT) is an evolving and protean disorder mostly recognized by generalized joint hypermobility and without a defined molecular basis. JHS/EDS-HT also presents with other connective tissue features affecting a variety of structures and organs, such as skin, eye, bone, and internal organs. However, most of these signs are present in variable combinations and severity in many other heritable connective tissue disorders. Accordingly, JHS/EDS-HT is an ""exclusion"" diagnosis which needs the absence of any consistent feature indicative of other partially overlapping connective tissue disorders. While both Villefranche and Brighton criteria include such an exclusion as a mandatory item, a systematic approach for reaching a stringent clinical diagnosis of JHS/EDS-HT is still lacking. The absence of a consensus on the diagnostic approach to JHS/EDS-HT concerning its clinical boundaries with similar conditions contribute to limit our actual understanding of the pathologic and molecular bases of this disorder. In this review, we revise the differential diagnosis of JHS/EDS-HT with those heritable connective tissue disorders which show a significant overlap with the former and mostly include EDS classic, vascular and kyphoscoliotic types, osteogenesis imperfecta, Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, arterial tortuosity syndrome, and lateral meningocele syndrome. A diagnostic flow chart is also offered with the attempt to support the less experienced clinician in stringently recognizing JHS/EDS-HT and stimulate the debate in the scientific community for both management and research purposes.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25821090/,hEDS,Differential diagnosis and diagnostic flow chart of joint hypermobility syndrome/ehlers-danlos syndrome hypermobility type compared to other heritable connective tissue disorders
6,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by painful, swollen joints that can severely impair physical function and quality of life. The presenting symptoms of musculoskeletal pain, swelling, and stiffness are common in clinical practice, so familiarity with diagnosing and managing RA is crucial. Patients with RA are at greater risk for serious infection, respiratory disease, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mortality than the general population. In recent years, early diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and expanded therapeutic options of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs have markedly improved both the management and long-term prognosis of RA",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30596879/,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Rheumatoid Arthritis
7,"Symptomatic Joint Hypermobility
Clinical problems associated with JH may present at any time of life. Syndromic or excessive JH can be difficult to diagnose in children, who are normally more flexible than adults [Tofts et al., 2009; Castori, 2012]. GJH is often diagnosed using the Beighton score (see also â€œMeasurement properties of existing clinical assessment methods for local and generalized joint hypermobilityâ€”a systematic review,â€ Juul-Kristensen et al., this issue), although this has major limitations in selected populations, such as the very young and the elderly [Dolan et al., 2003; Castori, 2012]. It can be asymptomatic, and is more common among dancers and elite athletes where it may confer a constitutional advantage [Day et al., 2011; Beighton et al., 2012]; however, it may predispose to higher injury rates [Briggs et al., 2009; Konopinski et al., 2015].

When symptomatic, it often manifests in childhood or adolescence, along with associated features, but is often poorly recognized [Engelbert et al., 2003]. Adults may recall being flexible as a child, and being able to perform â€œparty tricksâ€ with their joints. The two more common patterns of presentation are with: (1) a limited number of painful and/or unstable joints or (2) chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (which may have been diagnosed as fibromyalgia). In the former group, the more common problematic or unstable joints often presenting with recurrent subluxations/dislocations or pain are the shoulder, knee, and ankle [Tobias et al., 2013]. Iliotibial band syndrome (sometimes called â€œsnapping hipâ€ syndrome) is also common, and is frequently perceived by the patient as hip instability, even though the sense of motion occurs over the greater trochanters and not in the groin. In the group with chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, the pain distribution and descriptions often overlap with fibromyalgia to such an extent that it can be virtually impossible to distinguish [Ofluoglu et al., 2006; Ting et al., 2012]. It is important to recognize that there are many causes for both localized and widespread joint or musculoskeletal pain, and that the presence of pain alone without associated JH is insufficient to establish a diagnosis of EDS. Over time, many patients lose their former joint laxity, while others remain hypermobile [Castori, 2012]. This reduction in JH over time further complicates the diagnostic evaluation of chronic pain patients over approximately age 40.

In common with other chronic pain syndromes, there may also be overlapping diagnoses such as chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, sleep disturbance, as well as depression and anxiety. The specific associated impairments and their severity can vary markedly, and are not necessarily associated with the degree of joint laxity. Higher rates of anxiety and depression have been noted in GJH, hEDS, and JHS since 1994 [Lumley et al., 1994; Mallorqui-BaguÃ© et al., 2015]. Distress, kinesiophobia, and individualsâ€™ coping strategies and behavioral responses are more likely to predict impairment and quality of life (QoL) than the intensity of pain [Celletti et al., 2013]. Physical deconditioning can exacerbate joint laxity, contributing to an ongoing cycle of deconditioning, weakness, joint instability, and worsening pain [Castori, 2012].

In common with other chronic pain syndromes, there may also be overlapping diagnoses such as chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, sleep disturbance, as well as depression and anxiety. The specific associated impairment and their severity can vary markedly, and are not necessarily associated with the degree of joint laxity.

Pain
The specific underlying cause(s) and mechanism(s) of pain in EDS, and in particular hEDS, are not well understood, but both acute and chronic pain are common manifestations and often contribute to disability [Rombaut et al., 2010, 2011a,2011b, 2012; Voermans et al., 2010a,2010b; Castori et al., 2012a; Murray et al., 2013]. Nociceptive pain directly related to affected muscles, joints, and connective tissue is frequent. Neuropathic pain, characterized by allodynia and/or typical quality descriptors, such as electrical, burning, numb, or tingling, is also common. Anatomic imaging (e.g., for impingement of the central spine or foraminal nerve roots) and functional electrodiagnostic studies (e.g., nerve conduction studies or electromyography) are often negative even in the face of subjective symptoms highly suggestive of a neuropathic etiology. Skin biopsy may reveal reduction of intradermal nerve fiber density, suggestive of small fiber neuropathy [Cazzato et al., 2016].

Some potential etiologies of pain include spasm of muscles, tendons, and other connective tissue; direct trauma due to joint instability; and nerve entrapment [Granata et al., 2013]. Osteoarthritis, secondary to joint instability, is also a likely factor. Central sensitization, generalized hyperalgesia, chronic regional pain syndrome, and similar systemic or regional pathogenic mechanisms may contribute in later stages [Castori et al., 2013; Rombaut et al., 2015; Scheper et al., 2015, 2016a; Di Stefano et al., 2016]. See also â€œPain Management in the Ehlersâ€“Danlos Syndromesâ€ by Chopra et al., this issue.

Skin and Fascia
The Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes are primarily due to disorders of connective tissue matrix proteins, in particular, but not exclusively collagen (see also â€œThe Ehlersâ€“Danlos Syndromes: The Newâ€ by Malfait et al., this issue). It is presumed that the genetic determinants of hEDS are also likely of collagen or collagen-related genes. The dermis comprises 70% dry-weight collagen so that the skin presents itself as a visible, palpable, and readily accessible organ for the study of collagen-related genetic aberrations. The skin in hEDS is different from normal skin and these differences constitute an important aid to diagnosis. In hEDS, the skin texture is characteristically soft, silky, or velvety to the touch. It may be semi-transparent so that veins and tendons are more easily visible than normal, but this is subtle in comparison with the skin transparency of vascular EDS.

The skin in hEDS is also hyperextensible. The technique used is important in obtaining reliable results. The stretchiness is subtle in hEDS and can easily be overlooked if the clinician is anticipating the degree of stretch seen in classical EDS. The â€œrubber glove skin testâ€ may distinguish between hEDS skin and normal, by raising a skin fold on the dorsum of the hand in patients with hEDS, the skin is seen to stretch over a much wider area than is normal, extending to the wrist and beyond. However, the clinical evaluation of skin laxity follows that outlined in the new diagnostic criteria for hEDS (see also â€œThe 2017 International Classification of the Ehlersâ€“Danlos Syndromesâ€ by Malfait et al., this issue).

The hEDS skin is more fragile than normal, but much less so than in the other types of EDS. Easy bruising is common but poorly defined. Wound healing may be impaired with the production of mildly atrophic scars, which may be wider than the original wound and/or sunken below the surface of the surrounding skin. Again, the degree of atrophic scarring in hEDS is less severe than in and usually distinguishable from the other types of EDS (Fig. 2). However, its occurrence may be exacerbated by the use of local or systemic steroids [Jacks and Zirwas, 2016].",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajmg.c.31538,hEDS,Hypermobile Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome (a.k.a.

9,"          Importance:                    Fibromyalgia is present in as much as 2% to 8% of the population, is characterized by widespread pain, and is often accompanied by fatigue, memory problems, and sleep disturbances.              Objective:                    To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia.              Evidence review:                    The medical literature on fibromyalgia was reviewed from 1955 to March 2014 via MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, with an emphasis on meta-analyses and contemporary evidence-based treatment guidelines. Treatment recommendations are based on the most recent evidence-based guidelines from the Canadian Pain Society and graded from 1 to 5 based on the level of available evidence.              Findings:                    Numerous treatments are available for managing fibromyalgia that are supported by high-quality evidence. These include nonpharmacological therapies (education, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological therapies (tricyclics, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and gabapentinoids).              Conclusions and relevance:                    Fibromyalgia and other ""centralized"" pain states are much better understood now than ever before. Fibromyalgia may be considered as a discrete diagnosis or as a constellation of symptoms characterized by central nervous system pain amplification with concomitant fatigue, memory problems, and sleep and mood disturbances.

11,"            This review was written from the viewpoint of the treating clinician to educate health care professionals and the public about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It includes: the clinical definition of ME/CFS with emphasis on how to diagnose ME/CFS; the etiology, pathophysiology, management approach, long-term prognosis and economic cost of ME/CFS. After reading this review, you will be better able to diagnose and treat your patients with ME/CFS using the tools and information provided. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, chronic medical condition characterized by symptom clusters that include: pathological fatigue and malaise that is worse after exertion, cognitive dysfunction, immune dysfunction, unrefreshing sleep, pain, autonomic dysfunction, neuroendocrine and immune symptoms. ME/CFS is common, often severely disabling and costly. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed the ME/CFS literature and estimates that between 836,000 and 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS at a cost of between 17 and 24 billion dollars annually in the US. The IOM suggested a new name for ME/CFS and called it Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID). SEID's diagnostic criteria are less specific and do not exclude psychiatric disorders in the criteria. The 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey discovered that 29% of patients with ME/CFS had unmet health care needs and 20% had food insecurity--lack of access to sufficient healthy foods. ME/CFS can be severely disabling and cause patients to be bedridden. Yet most patients (80%) struggle to get a diagnosis because doctors have not been taught how to diagnose or treat ME/CFS in medical schools or in their post-graduate educational training. Consequently, the patients with ME/CFS suffer. They are not diagnosed with ME/CFS and are not treated accordingly. Instead of compassionate care from their doctors, they are often ridiculed by the very people from whom they seek help. The precise etiology of ME/CFS remains unknown, but recent advances and research discoveries are beginning to shed light on the enigma of this disease including the following contributors: infectious, genetic, immune, cognitive including sleep, metabolic and biochemical abnormalities. Management of patients with ME/CFS is supportive symptomatic treatment with a patient centered care approach that begins with the symptoms that are most troublesome for the patient. Pacing of activities with strategic rest periods is, in our opinion, the most important coping strategy patients can learn to better manage their illness and stop their post-exertional fatigue and malaise. Pacing allows patients to regain the ability to plan activities and begin to make slow incremental improvements in functionality.

12,"          Objective:                    To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Gaucher's disease, focusing on the role of enzyme replacement therapy.              Data sources:                    A MEDLINE search (from 1984 to July 1995) of English-language literature pertaining to the treatment of Gaucher's disease was performed. Additional references were obtained by reviewing the references of pertinent articles identified through the search. Tertiary sources were also used.              Study selection and data extraction:                    Articles with information on enzyme treatment were selected for review. Articles containing other interesting aspects of the disease or its treatment were also included.              Data synthesis:                    Gaucher's disease is the most common lipid storage disorder known and results from a genetic deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (glucosylceramidase). Enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of glucocerebroside within the reticuloendothelial system. It may present with hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow suppression, and bone lesions. The most common of the three subtypes, type 1, is non-neuronopathic. In the rare neuronopathic subtypes, type 2 or 3, there may also be nerve cell destruction within the central nervous system with acute brainstem dysfunction or progressive neurologic deterioration, respectively. In 1991, enzyme treatment became available with the marketing of alglucerase, a placentally derived modified form of glucocerebrosidase. In 1994, a recombinant DNA modified form of glucocerebrosidase, known as imiglucerase, was developed to replace alglucerase. Most published data on enzyme therapy are with alglucerase in patients with type 1 disease. A dosage regimen of 60 units/kg every 2 weeks for moderately to severely ill patients has been effective in reducing hepatosplenomegaly, improving anemia and thrombocytopenia, as well as improving weight gain and growth in children and increasing vigor and self-esteem in adults. Bone involvement is often slow to respond to therapy although pain is frequently improved. Controversy exists as to whether lower dosage regimens are as effective. The role of enzyme therapy in the rarer neuronopathic subtypes remains to be determined, but initial reports have been disappointing.              Conclusions:                    Enzyme replacement therapy is available for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher's disease, resulting in clinical improvement with enhanced quality of life within the first year of treatment, although improvement in bone disease can take longer. Doses of 60 units/kg every 2 weeks are of clinical benefit to patients with moderate to severe disease. A number of lower dosage regimens have been evaluated in small groups of patients, with satisfactory clinical responses occurring in some of these patients.

13,"            Nonspecific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as postprandial cramping pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are typical symptoms for irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, but may also be the first symptoms of Fabry disease (FD). This review focus on GI manifestations in FD, by providing an overview of symptoms, a proper diagnosis, an appropriate management by FD-specific and concomitant medications and lifestyle interventions. We provide comprehensive literature-based data combined with personal experience in the management of FD patients. Since FD is rare and the clinical phenotype is heterogeneous, affected patients are often misdiagnosed. Consequently, physicians should consider FD as a possible differential diagnosis when assessing unspecific GI symptoms. Improved diagnostic tools, such as a modified GI symptom assessment scale can facilitate the diagnosis of FD in patients with GI symptoms of unknown cause and thus enable the timely initiation of a disease-specific therapy. Expansive intravenous enzyme replacement therapy with Î±-galactosidase A or oral chaperone therapy for patients with amenable mutations improve the disease burden including GI symptoms, but a timely start of therapy is crucial for the prognosis. A special diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) or pro- and prebiotics might improve FD-typical GI symptoms. Furthermore, preliminary success was reported with the oral administration of Î±-galactosidase A. In addition to a timely initiation of FD-specific therapy, affected patients with GI symptoms might benefit from a FODMAP-low diet, pro- and prebiotics and/or low-cost oral substitution with AGAL to support digestion and reduce dysbiosis.

14,"            Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid cells, bone marrow fibrosis and cytopenias, extramedullary hematopoiesis and hepatosplenomegaly, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and systemic symptoms. Patients with MF also have a propensity toward leukemic transformation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHCT) is the only curative therapy for patients with MF; however, transplant-related morbidity and mortality precludes this option for the majority of patients. In the last decade, two targeted therapies have been approved for the treatment of MF, both JAK2 inhibitors, ruxolitinib and fedratinib. Despite the clinical efficacy of these two compounds in terms of splenomegaly and symptom burden reduction, there remain many areas of unmet need in the treatment of myelofibrosis. In this review, we discuss the limitations of currently approved treatment options and novel therapeutic targets with drug candidates in late-stage (phase II or III) clinical development for the treatment of MF. We delve into the mechanism of action and scientific rational of each candidate agent as well as the available clinical data, and ongoing trials that could lead to the approval of some of these novel therapies.

15,"            In contrast to solid cancers, which often require genetic modifications and complex cellular reprogramming for effective metastatic dissemination, leukaemic cells uniquely possess the innate ability for migration and invasion. Dedifferentiated, malignant leukocytes retain the benign leukocytes' capacity for cell motility and survival in the circulation, while acquiring the potential for rapid and uncontrolled cell division. For these reasons, leukaemias, although not traditionally considered as metastatic diseases, are in fact models of highly efficient metastatic spread. Accordingly, they are often aggressive and challenging diseases to treat. In this Perspective, we discuss the key molecular processes that facilitate metastasis in a variety of leukaemic subtypes, the clinical significance of leukaemic invasion into specific tissues and the current pipeline of treatments targeting leukaemia metastasis.

It affects slightly more boys than girls.Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is different to other types of leukaemia, includingÂ acute myeloid leukaemia,Â chronic lymphocytic leukaemiaÂ and chronic myeloid leukaemia.What happens in acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaAll the blood cells in the body are produced by bone marrow, which is a spongy material found inside bones.Bone marrow produces stem cells, which have the ability to develop into three important types of blood cells:red blood cells â€“ which carry oxygen around the bodywhite blood cells â€“ which help fight infectionplatelets â€“ which help stop bleedingBone marrow does not usually release stem cells into the blood until they have become fully developed blood cells. But in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, large numbers of white blood cells are released before they are ready. TheseÂ are known as blast cells.As the number of blast cells increases, the number of red blood cells and platelet cells decreases. This causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, breathlessness and an increased risk of excessive bleeding.Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection.Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaAcute lymphoblastic leukaemiaÂ usually starts slowly before rapidly becoming severe as the number of immature white blood cells (blast cells) in your blood increases.Most of the symptoms are caused by a lack of healthy blood cells. Symptoms include:pale skinfeeling tired and breathlessrepeated infections over a short timeunusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleedshigh temperaturenight sweatsbone and joint paineasily bruised skinswollen lymph nodes (glands)tummy (abdominal pain) â€“ caused by a swollen liver or spleenunintentional weight lossa purple skin rash (purpura)In some cases, the affected cells can spread from your bloodstream into your central nervous system. This can cause neurological symptoms (related to the brain and nervous system), including:headachesseizures or fitsbeing sickblurred visiondizzinessWhen to get medical adviceIf you or your child has some or all the symptoms listed on this page, it's still highly unlikely that acute leukaemia is the cause. However, see a GP as soon as possible because any condition that causes these symptoms needs prompt investigation and treatment.Find out more about diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.What causesÂ acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaA genetic change (mutation) in the stem cells causes immature white blood cells to be released into the bloodstream.What causes the DNA mutation to happen is not yet understood, but known risk factors include:previous chemotherapyÂ â€“ if you've had chemotherapyÂ to treat another type of cancer in the past, your risk ofÂ developing acute lymphoblasticÂ leukaemia is increased. The risk relates to certain types of chemotherapy medicine, such as etoposide, and how much treatment you hadsmoking â€“Â smokers are much more likely to develop acute leukaemia than non-smokers, and studies have shown that parents who smoke in the home may increase the risk of leukaemia in their childrenbeing veryÂ overweight (obese)Â â€“ some studies have shown that people who are very overweight have a slightly higher risk of developing leukaemia than those who are a healthy weightgenetic disordersÂ â€“ a small numberÂ of cases of childhood acute lymphoblasticÂ leukaemia are thought to be related to genetic disorders, including Down's syndromehaving a weakened immune systemÂ â€“Â people with lowered immunity (as a result of havingÂ HIV or AIDS or taking immunosuppressants) have an increased risk of developing leukaemiaEnvironmental factorsExtensive research has been done to determine whether the following environmental factors could be a trigger for leukaemia:living near a nuclear power stationliving near a power lineliving near a building or facility that releases electro-magnetic radiation, such as a mobile phone mastThere's currently no firm evidence to suggest that any of these environmental factors increases the risk of developing leukaemia.Cancer Research UK has more information about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia risks and causes.Treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaAs acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is an aggressive condition that develops quickly, treatment usually begins a few days after diagnosis.Treatment is usually done in the following stages:Â remission induction â€“ the first stage of treatment aims to kill the leukaemia cells in your bone marrow, restore the balance of cells in your blood and resolve any symptoms you may haveconsolidation â€“ this stage aims to kill any remaining leukaemiamaintenance â€“ this stage involves taking regular doses ofÂ chemotherapy medicines to prevent leukaemia from returningChemotherapy is the main treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Other treatments you may need includeÂ antibiotics and blood transfusions. Sometimes a stem cell transplant may also be needed to achieve a cure.Find out more about treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.Complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemiaIf a cure for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is not possible, there's a risk that the lack of healthy blood cells can make the person:extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections (because they do not have enough healthy white blood cells to fight infections)prone to uncontrolled and serious bleeding (because there are not enough platelets in their blood)These two complications, and others, are discussed further in complications of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.OutlookOne of the biggest factors that affects the outlook for people with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is age. The younger a person is when they are diagnosed and treatment begins, the better the outlook.From the available data in England it is estimated that:in those aged 14 or younger, more than 9 in 10 will survive leukaemia for 5 years or longer after diagnosisin those aged 15 to 24, almost 7 in 10 will survive leukaemia for 5 years or longer after diagnosisin those aged 25 to 64, almost 4 in 10 will survive leukaemia for 5 years or longer after diagnosisin those aged 65 or older, almost 15 in 100 will survive leukaemia for 5 years or longer after diagnosisHelp and supportFind more information about cancer.If you or a family member has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Leukaemia Care provides further information, advice and support.Call Leukaemia Care's free helpline on 08088 010 444 or email: support@leukaemiacare.org.ukThe charity Cancer UK also has more information about acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

19,"Myositis is the name for a group of rare conditions. The main symptoms are weak, painful or aching muscles. This usually gets worse, slowly over time.You may also trip or fall a lot, and be very tired after walking or standing. If you have any of these symptoms you should see a GP.Myositis is usually caused by a problem with your immune system, where it mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.Types of myositisThere are different types of myositis, including:Polymyositis, which affects many different muscles, particularly the shoulders, hips and thigh muscles. It's more common in women and tends to affect people aged 30 to 60.Dermatomyositis, which affects several muscles and causes a rash. It's more common in women and can also affect children (juvenile dermatomyositis).Inclusion body myositis (IBM), which causes weakness in the thigh muscles, forearm muscles and the muscles below the knee. It may also cause problems with swallowing (dysphagia). IBM is more common in men and tends to affect people over 50.The UK charity Myositis UK has more information about the different types of myositis.This page covers polymyositis and dermatomyositis, which are the 2 most common types.Symptoms of polymyositisPolymyositis affects many different muscles, particularly around the neck, shoulders, back, hips and thighs.Symptoms of polymyositis include:muscle weaknessaching or painful muscles and feeling very tiredfinding it hard to sit up, or stand after a fallswallowing problems, or finding it hard to hold your head upfeeling unhappy or depressedYou may find it difficult to get up from a chair, climb stairs, lift objects, and comb your hair. The muscle weakness can become so severe that even picking up a cup of tea can be difficult.The muscle weakness may change from week to week or month to month, although it tends to steadily get worse if you do not get treatment.Symptoms of dermatomyositisThe symptoms of dermatomyositis are similar to those of polymyositis, but there's also a distinctive rash.Before the muscle symptoms start, a red, purple or dark rash often appears. It is usually on the face (eyelids, nose and cheeks), and hands (knuckles). It can also sometimes be seen on the back, upper chest, elbows and knees.The rash can be itchy or painful, and you may also get hard lumps of tissue under your skin.Diagnosing myositisA GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine you. If they think you may have myositis, you'll need to have some tests to help rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.Tests you may have include:blood tests, to check for raised levels of enzymes and antibodies in your bloodtaking a small sample of muscle tissue or skin (biopsy) so it can be examined for swelling, damage and other changesMRI scanselectromyography (EMG), where a small needle-shaped electrode is put through your skin and into your muscle, after a local anaesthetic, to record the electrical signals from the nerve endings in your musclesTreating myositisExercise and physiotherapyExercise is a very important part of treatment for all types of myositis. It can help reduce swelling, give you more energy, and build up or restore your muscle strength.Exercise and physiotherapy are particularly important if you have inclusion body myositis (IBM), as these are the only treatments for this type of myositis. IBM cannot be treated with medicines.You should speak to a GP and physiotherapist before starting a new exercise programme for myositis. They will help to make an exercise plan that is right for you.You must be very careful about exercising if you have severe symptoms of myositis, such as severe muscle pain and weakness (a ""flare up""). Most specialists do not recommend exercising during this period.But, it's very important to maintain gentle movement of your muscles and joints, especially if myositis developed during childhood. This makes sure that your joints do not become stiff and end up in a fixed position.SteroidsSteroids are the main type of medicine used to treat polymyositis and dermatomyositis. They help to quickly reduce swelling and ease muscle pain.They can be given as a tablet or injection, or directly into a vein through a drip. You will usually be given a high dose to start with, which is reduced over time.High doses of steroids taken over a long time can cause side effects. These include:weight gainhigh blood pressurediabetescataracts (cloudy patches in the lens of the eye)osteoporosis (weakened bones)Read more about the side effects of steroid medicines.Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugsIf the swelling in your muscles flares up, your doctor may prescribe a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD).DMARDs, such as azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate, suppress your immune system and help reduce swelling.These medicines take time to work, but in the long term, they may help you to reduce your dose of steroids. This can help ease the side effects of steroids.Immunoglobulin therapyVery rarely, you may need immunoglobulin therapy to stop your immune system attacking your muscles.This involves having an injection of healthy antibodies (immunoglobulins) from donated blood.Immunoglobulin therapy is given in hospital, usually directly into a vein through a drip. You may need more than 1 treatment.Biologic therapiesBiologic therapies, such as rituximab, can also help manage the symptoms of myositis. They are widely used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.They help to reduce swelling and tend to only be used for severe myositis.OutlookMost people with myositis respond to a combination of steroid and immunosuppressive therapy, alongside carefully controlled exercise.Steroids are often needed, in very low doses for several years, as well as medicines to suppress the immune system. This can lead to an increased risk of infection. In most cases this can be easily managed with antibiotics if it becomes a problem.Complications of myositisSome people with myositis do not respond well to treatment and find the condition significantly affects their everyday activities and quality of life. But continuing to exercise usually helps improve muscle strength.If you have severe myositis, you may develop breathing and swallowing problems. Speech and language therapy may be recommended if you're having problems swallowing or it's affecting your ability to communicate.In rare cases, myositis can be associated with cancer, and you may be offered tests to check for cancer.Help and supportMyositis UK provides further information and support for people who are diagnosed with myositis and their families.The Myositis Association (of America) also provides information about polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

You may be prescribed a capsaicin cream or patch to make the heat receptors in your skin less sensitive.A local anaesthetic called lidocaine may also be prescribed in the form of a cream, gel or spray.A GP will be able to give you more information about these medicines and if they're right for you.You can also speak to a pharmacist about lidocaine creams.Medicines taken by mouthA number of different medicines taken by mouth (orally) may help relieve the symptoms of erythromelalgia.You may need to try several different medicines, under the supervision of a doctor, before you find the one or the combination that works best for you.Your treatment options will also depend on the type of erythromelalgia you have.Many treatments require referral to a specialist centre so benefits and potential side effects can be closely monitored.The types of medicine a doctor may prescribe include:dietary supplements â€“ such as magnesium, which can help open up your blood vesselsaspirin â€“ only used for adults, not for childrenanti-epilepsy medicines â€“ such as gabapentin or carbamazepineblood pressure medicines â€“ medicine to either open up your blood vessels and increase blood flow, or beta blockers to help reduce blood flow, depending on the cause of your erythromelalgialow doses of antidepressants â€“ such as duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline or nortriptylineprescription-only painkillersMedicines given through a dripIf oral medicine does not manage to control your symptoms, you may be given medicine directly into the bloodstream through a drip (intravenous infusion).Lidocaine, a local anaesthetic that can help nerve-related pain, can be given this way. But how long it works for varies between people.Your doctor will explain this procedure to you and how you should prepare for it.Causes of erythromelalgiaThe cause of erythromelalgia is usually unknown.But it's sometimes caused by another underlying medical condition or a faulty gene inherited from a parent.Other medical conditionsErythromelalgia sometimes results from an underlying condition, such as:a blood disorder â€“ like polycythaemianerve damage â€“ for example, caused by peripheral neuropathymultiple sclerosis (MS)an autoimmune problem â€“ such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, where the immune system attacks the body's own tissuesIt may also be caused by certain medicines. Your doctor will be able to give you more information on this.Genetic causeSome people with erythromelalgia have a faulty gene that causes the condition.Erythromelalgia can run in families when the faulty gene is passed down (inherited) from a parent to their child.The faulty gene causes changes in the way pain signals are delivered to the brain, increasing or strengthening them.More information and supportSpecialist centres in the UKFor children: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children Pain Control ServiceFor adults: National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Pain Management CentreOrganisations that provide supportThe Erythromelalgia AssociationFoundation for Peripheral NeuropathyPain ConcernNational Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration ServiceIf you or your child has erythromelalgia, your clinical team will pass theÂ informationÂ on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).The NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat erythromelalgia.

But it can sometimes take longer to get better.Ongoing treatment for rheumatic feverIf you have had rheumatic fever once, it makes it more likely that it could come back, so make sure to get sore throats treated early.You may also have to take antibiotics for several years to help stop it returning.It's less likely that it will come back if it's been 5 years since you last had an episode. The younger you are, the more likely it is that rheumatic fever will come back.It can also cause permanent damage to your heart (rheumatic heart disease). This can take years to show up, so you may need regular check-ups and further treatment when you're older.Always ask a doctor what ongoing treatment you may need.Non-urgent advice:  See a GP if:      you've had rheumatic fever before and you think it's come backyou've had a bacterial throat infection recently and you develop symptoms of rheumatic feverSymptoms of rheumatic feverSymptoms usually appear 1 to 5 weeks after you have had a bacterial throat infection.They include:a high temperatureredness, pain and swelling of your joints (arthritis), usually ankles, knees, wrists or elbowspain in your chest, breathlessness and a fast heart ratejerky, uncontrollable movements in your hands, feet and facetiny bumps under your skinpale-red patches on your arms and tummy (abdomen)Causes of rheumatic feverRheumatic fever happens after a bacterial throat or skin infection.

22,"            The incidence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is 8 to 51 per 100,000 people worldwide. It most commonly affects children 5 to 15 years of age after a group A streptococcal infection. Overcrowding and poor socioeconomic conditions are directly proportional to the incidence of ARF. Rheumatic carditis is a manifestation of ARF that may lead to rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Timely treatment of group A streptococcal infection can prevent ARF, and penicillin prophylaxis can prevent recurrence of ARF. Prevention of recurrent ARF is the most effective way to prevent RHD. ARF is diagnosed using the 2015 modified Jones criteria. There is no gold standard laboratory test. Therefore, clinicians need to be aware of the clinical signs and symptoms of ARF to include in their differential diagnosis when seeing such patients. Secondary prophylaxis with benzathine penicillin G has been shown to decrease the incidence of RHD and is key to RHD control. Clinicians need to understand the implications of secondary prophylaxis for ARF. There is also a need to improve ARF diagnosis, to find novel therapies to reduce the incidence of ARF, and to reduce the prevalence of RHD. RHD research is neglected and underfunded. Thus, there is also a need for RHD advocacy and public health awareness to increase research on RHD.    ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33931507/,Rheumatic Fever,Acute Rheumatic fever
23,"Arthritis is a common condition that causes pain and inflammation in aÂ joint.In the UK, millions of people have arthritis or other, similar conditions that affect the joints.Arthritis affects peopleÂ of all ages, including children.Types of arthritisOsteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are the 2 most common types of arthritis.OsteoarthritisOsteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis in the UK.It most often develops inÂ people in their mid-40s or older.It's also more common in women andÂ people with a family history ofÂ the condition.Â But it can occur at any age as a result of an injury or be associated with otherÂ joint-related conditions, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis.Osteoarthritis initially affects the smooth cartilage lining of the joint. This makes movement more difficult than usual, leading to pain and stiffness.Once the cartilage lining starts to roughen and thin out, the tendons and ligaments have to work harder.This can cause swelling and the formation of bony spurs called osteophytes.Severe loss of cartilage can lead to bone rubbing on bone, altering the shape of the joint and forcing the bones out of their normal position.The most commonly affected jointsÂ are those in the:handsspinekneeshipsFind out more about osteoarthritisRheumatoid arthritisRheumatoid arthritis is less common than osteoarthritis.It often starts when a person is between 30 and 50 years old. Women are more likely to be affected than men.In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system targets affected joints, which leads to pain and swelling.Â The outer covering (synovium) of the joint is the first place affected.This can then spread across the joint, leading to further swelling and a change in the joint's shape. ThisÂ may cause theÂ bone and cartilage to break down.People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop problems with other tissues and organs in their body.Find out more about rheumatoid arthritisOther types of arthritis and related conditionsankylosing spondylitisÂ â€“Â a long-term inflammatoryÂ condition that mainly affects the bones, muscles and ligaments of the spine, leading to stiffness and joints fusing together.Â Other problems can include the swelling of tendons, eyes and large jointscervicalÂ spondylosisÂ â€“Â also known as degenerative osteoarthritis, cervical spondylitis affects the joints and bones in the neck, which can lead to pain and stiffnessfibromyalgiaÂ â€“Â causes pain in the body's muscles, ligaments and tendonslupusÂ â€“Â an autoimmune condition that can affect many different organs and the body's tissuesgoutÂ â€“Â a type of arthritis caused by too much uric acid in the body.

It can also causeÂ joint inflammationSymptoms of arthritisThere are lots of different types of arthritis.The symptoms you experience will vary depending on the type you have.This is why it's important to have an accurate diagnosis if you have:joint pain, tenderness and stiffnessinflammation in and around the jointsrestricted movement of the jointswarm red skin over the affected jointweakness and muscle wastingArthritis and childrenArthritis is often associated with older people, butÂ it can alsoÂ affect children.Most types of childhood arthritis are known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).JIA causes pain andÂ inflammation in 1 or more joints for at least 6 weeks.Although the exact cause of JIA isÂ unknown, the symptoms often improve as a child gets older, meaning they can lead a normal life.Oligo-articular JIA (oligoarthritis)Oligo-articular JIA is the most common type of JIA. It affects up to 4 joints in the body, most commonly in the knees, ankles and wrists.Oligo-articular JIA often goes away without causing long-term joint damage.But there's a risk that childrenÂ with the condition may develop eye problems, so regularÂ eyeÂ tests with an eyecare specialist called an ophthalmologist are recommended.Polyarticular JIA (polyarthritis)Polyarticular JIA, or polyarthritis, is the second most common type of JIA and affects 5 or more joints.It can affect a child of any age and may come on suddenly or develop gradually.The symptoms of polyarticular JIA are similar to the symptoms of adult rheumatoid arthritis.A child with the condition may also feel unwell and may occasionally have a high temperature of 38C or above.Systemic onset JIASystemic onset JIA begins with symptoms such as a fever, rash, a lack of energy and enlarged glands. Later on, joints canÂ become swollen and inflamed.Like polyarticular JIA, systemic onset JIA can affect children of any age.Enthesitis-related arthritisEnthesitis-related arthritis is a type of juvenile arthritis that often affects the joints of the leg and spine, causing inflammation where the tendons attach to the bone.It can cause stiffness in the neck and lower back in the teenage years.It's also linked to a painful eye condition called acute uveitis.Find out moreVersus Arthritis: juvenile idiopathic arthritisTreating arthritisThere's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow it down.Osteoarthritis treatments include lifestyle changes, medicines and surgery.Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aimsÂ to slow the condition's progress and minimise joint inflammation.

24,"            Most arthritides are associated with pain and psychological distress (clinically significant depression and anxiety). Pain and depression are mutually exacerbating; both may continue even when joint involvement appears well controlled. Area covered: There is strong evidence that arthritis-related stress impacts the central nervous system and, together with peripheral inflammatory changes, can cause central sensitization that can lead to chronic pain and worsening of affective distress. Cytokines and chemokines participate both in joint inflammation and in central sensitization. We review evidence of these relationships in five arthritides, namely rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and in osteoarthritis of the hips and knees. Central sensitization in these conditions results in long-lasting pain and psychological distress. Expert commentary: Chronic pain and depression are important but often neglected in the clinical assessment and treatment of arthritis.

26,"Gaucher's disease or Gaucher disease (/ɡoʊˈʃeɪ/) (GD) is a genetic disorder in which glucocerebroside (a sphingolipid, also known as glucosylceramide) accumulates in cells and certain organs. The disorder is characterized by bruising, fatigue, anemia, low blood platelet count and enlargement of the liver and spleen, and is caused by a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramidase), which acts on glucocerebroside. When the enzyme is defective, glucocerebroside accumulates, particularly in white blood cells and especially in macrophages (mononuclear leukocytes, which is often a target for intracellular parasites). Glucocerebroside can collect in the spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, and bone marrow.

Manifestations may include enlarged spleen and liver, liver malfunction, skeletal disorders or bone lesions that may be painful, severe neurological complications, swelling of lymph nodes and (occasionally) adjacent joints, distended abdomen, a brownish tint to the skin, anemia, low blood platelet count, and yellow fatty deposits on the white of the eye (sclera). Persons seriously affected may also be more susceptible to infection. Some forms of Gaucher's disease may be treated with enzyme replacement therapy.

The disease is caused by a recessive mutation in the GBA gene located on chromosome 1 and affects both males and females. About one in 100 people in the United States are carriers of the most common type of Gaucher disease. The carrier rate among Ashkenazi Jews is 8.9% while the birth incidence is one in 450.[1]

Gaucher's disease is the most common of the lysosomal storage diseases.[2] It is a form of sphingolipidosis (a subgroup of lysosomal storage diseases), as it involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids.[3]

The disease is named after the French physician Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882.[4]

Signs and symptoms
Painless hepatomegaly and splenomegaly: the size of the spleen can be 1500–3000 g, as opposed to the normal size of 50–200 g. Splenomegaly may decrease the affected individual's capacity for eating by exerting pressure on the stomach. While painless, enlargement of spleen increases the risk of splenic rupture.
Hypersplenism and pancytopenia, the rapid and premature destruction of blood cells, leads to anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia (with an increased risk of infection and bleeding).
Cirrhosis of the liver is rare.
Severe pain associated with joints and bones occurs, frequently presenting in hips and knees.
Neurological symptoms occur only in some types of Gaucher's (see below):
Type I: impaired olfaction and cognition
Type II: serious convulsions, hypertonia, intellectual disability, and apnea
Type III: muscle twitches known as myoclonus, convulsions, dementia, and ocular muscle apraxia
Parkinson's disease is recognized as being more common in Gaucher's disease patients and their heterozygous carrier relatives.[5]
Osteoporosis: 75% of patients develop visible bony abnormalities due to the accumulated glucosylceramide. A deformity of the distal femur in the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask is commonly described.
Yellowish-brown skin pigmentation
Genetics
The three types of Gaucher's disease are autosomal recessive. Both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected. If both parents are carriers, the chance of the disease is one in four, or 25%, with each pregnancy for an affected child. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended for families who may be carriers of mutations.[citation needed]

Each type has been linked to particular mutations. In all, about 80 known GBA gene mutations are grouped into three main types:[6]

Type I (N370S homozygote), the most common, also called the ""non-neuropathic"" type occurs mainly in Ashkenazi Jews, at 100 times the occurrence in the general populace. The median age at diagnosis is 28 years of age,[7] and life expectancy is mildly decreased.[8]
Type II (one or two alleles L444P) is characterized by neurological problems in small children. The enzyme is hardly released into the lysosomes. Prognosis is poor: most die before the age of three.
Type III (also one or two copies of L444P, possibly delayed by protective polymorphisms) occurs in Swedish patients from the Norrbotten region.[9] This group develops the disease somewhat later, but most die before their 30th birthday.
The Gaucher-causing mutations may have entered the Ashkenazi Jewish gene pool in the early Middle Ages (48–55 generations ago).[10]

Pathophysiology
The disease is caused by a defect in the housekeeping gene for lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (also known as beta-glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.45, PDB: 1OGS​) on the first chromosome (1q22). The enzyme is a 55.6-kilodalton, 497-amino acid-long protein that catalyses the breakdown of glucocerebroside, a cell membrane constituent of red and white blood cells. In Gaucher disease, the enzyme is unable to function correctly and glucocerebroside accumulates. The macrophages that clear these cells are unable to eliminate the waste product, which accumulates in fibrils, and turn into 'Gaucher cells', which appear on light microscopy to resemble crumpled-up paper.[3]

The exact mechanism of neurotoxicity is not understood, but it is thought to involve a reaction to glucosylsphingosine.[3]

Different mutations in the GBA (beta-glucosidase) gene determine the remaining activity of the enzyme. In type I, there is some residual activity of the enzyme, accounting for the lack of neuropathology in this type.[3] Although there is some correlation between genotype and phenotype, neither the amount of stored lipids, nor the residual enzyme activity correlates well with disease symptoms.[11] This circumstance has called for alternative explanations accounting for disease symptoms including

jamming of the endo/lysosomal system[12]
ER stress[13]
altered lipid composition of membranes throughout the cell, including the plasma membrane,[14] and consequent changes in the dynamic and signaling properties of the cell membrane[15]
inflammation caused by cytokine secretion as a result of sphingolipid accumulation, and neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of glucosylsphingosine, a neurotoxin[16]
Heterozygotes for particular acid beta-glucosidase mutations carry about a five-fold risk of developing Parkinson's disease, making this the most common known genetic risk factor for Parkinson's.[17][18]

Cancer risk may be increased, particularly myeloma.[19][20][21] This is thought to be due to accumulation of glucosylceramide and complex glycosphingolipids.[22]

The role of inflammatory processes in Gaucher disease is poorly elucidated. However, sphingolipids are known to participate in inflammation and apoptosis, and markers of macrophage activation are elevated in people with Gaucher disease. These markers include angiotensin-converting enzyme, cathepsin S, chitotriosidase, and CCL18 in the blood plasma; and tumor necrosis factor alpha in splenic Gaucher cells (engorged macrophages).[3]

Diagnosis

Gaucher disease is suggested based on the overall clinical picture. Initial laboratory testing may include enzyme testing. As a result, lower than 15% of mean normal activity is considered to be diagnostic.[23] Decreased enzyme levels will often be confirmed by genetic testing. Numerous different mutations occur; sequencing of the beta-glucosidase gene is sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis is available and is useful when a known genetic risk factor is present.[citation needed]

A diagnosis can also be implied by biochemical abnormalities such as high alkaline phosphatase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and immunoglobulin levels, or by cell analysis showing ""crinkled paper"" cytoplasm and glycolipid-laden macrophages.[citation needed]

Some lysosomal enzymes are elevated, including tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, hexosaminidase, and a human chitinase, chitotriosidase. This latter enzyme has proved to be very useful for monitoring Gaucher's disease activity in response to treatment, and may reflect the severity of the disease[24]

Classification
Gaucher's disease (GD) has three common clinical subtypes.[25][26] These subtypes have come under some criticism for not taking account of the full spectrum of observable symptoms (the phenotypes[27]). Also, compound heterozygous variations occur which considerably increase the complexity of predicting disease course.

GD type I (non-neuropathic) is the most common and least severe form of the disease. Symptoms may begin early in life or in adulthood and mainly affect the liver, spleen, and bone. Enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen (together hepatosplenomegaly) are common;[3] the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive.[3] Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The brain and nervous system are not affected pathologically,[3] but lung and, rarely, kidney impairment may occur. Patients in this group usually bruise easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type I patients may live well into adulthood. The range and severity of symptoms can vary dramatically between patients.[citation needed]

GD type II (acute infantile neuropathic) typically begins within six months of birth and has an incidence rate around 1 in 100,000 live births. Symptoms include an enlarged liver and spleen, extensive and progressive brain damage, eye movement disorders, spasticity, seizures, limb rigidity, and a poor ability to suck and swallow. Affected children usually die by age two.

GD type III (chronic neuropathic) can begin at any time in childhood or even in adulthood, and occurs in about 1 in 100,000 live births. It is characterized by slowly progressive, but milder neurologic symptoms compared to the acute or type II version. Major symptoms include an enlarged spleen and/or liver, seizures, poor coordination, skeletal irregularities, eye movement disorders, blood disorders including anemia, and respiratory problems. Patients often live into their early teen years and adulthood.[28]

Treatment
For those with type-I and most type-III, enzyme replacement treatment with intravenous recombinant glucocerebrosidase can decrease liver and spleen size, reduce skeletal abnormalities, and reverse other manifestations.[16][29] This treatment costs about US$200,000 annually for a single person and should be continued for life. The rarity of the disease means dose-finding studies have been difficult to conduct, so controversy remains over the optimal dose and dosing frequency.[7] Due to the low incidence, this has become an orphan drug in many countries, meaning a government recognizes and accommodates the financial constraints that limit research into drugs that address a small population.[citation needed]

The first drug for Gaucher's was alglucerase (Ceredase), which was a version of glucocerebrosidase that was harvested from human placental tissue and then modified with enzymes.[30] It was approved by the FDA in 1991[31] and has been withdrawn from the market[32][33] due to the approval of similar drugs made with recombinant DNA technology instead of being harvested from tissue; drugs made recombinantly are preferable, since there is no concern about diseases being transmitted from the tissue used in harvesting, there are fewer risks of variations in enzyme structure from batch to batch, and they are less expensive to manufacture.[30]

Available recombinant glucocerebrosidases are:[16]

Imiglucerase (approved in 1995)[30]
Velaglucerase (approved in 2010)[34]
Taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) (approved in 2012)[35]
Miglustat is a small molecule, orally available drug that was first approved for Gaucher's disease in Europe in 2002.[36] It works by preventing the formation of glucocerebroside, the substance that builds up and causes harm in Gaucher's. This approach is called substrate reduction therapy.[37]

Eliglustat (Cerdelga) (approved in 2014)[38] is also a small molecule. The compound is believed to work by inhibition of glucosylceramide synthase.

Epidemiology
The National Gaucher Foundation (United States) states the incidence of Gaucher's disease is about one in 20,000 live births.[39] Around one in 100 people in the general US population is a carrier for type I Gaucher's disease, giving a prevalence of one in 40,000.[40] Among Ashkenazi Jews, the rate of carriers is considerably higher, at roughly one in 15.[40]

Type II Gaucher's disease shows no particular preference for any ethnic group.[citation needed]

Type III Gaucher's disease is especially common in the population of the northern Swedish region of Norrbotten, where the incidence of the disease is one in 50,000.[41]

History
The disease was first recognized by the French doctor Philippe Gaucher, who originally described it in 1882 and lent his name to the condition.[4] In 1902, its mode of inheritance was discovered by Nathan Brill.[3] The neuronal damage associated with the disease was discovered in the 1920s, and the biochemical basis for the disease was elucidated in the 1960s by Roscoe Brady.[3][42] The first effective treatment for the disease, the drug alglucerase (Ceredase), was approved by the FDA in April 1991. An improved drug, imiglucerase (Cerezyme), was approved by the FDA in May 1994 and has replaced the use of Ceredase.

27,"Fabry disease, also known as Anderson–Fabry disease, is a rare genetic disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the kidneys, heart, and skin.[1] Fabry disease is one of a group of conditions known as lysosomal storage diseases. The genetic mutation that causes Fabry disease interferes with the function of an enzyme that processes biomolecules known as sphingolipids, leading to these substances building up in the walls of blood vessels and other organs. It is inherited in an X-linked manner.

Fabry disease is sometimes diagnosed using a blood test that measures the activity of the affected enzyme called alpha-galactosidase, but genetic testing is also sometimes used, particularly in females.

The treatment for Fabry disease varies depending on the organs affected by the condition, and the underlying cause can be addressed by replacing the enzyme that is lacking.

The first descriptions of the condition were made simultaneously by dermatologist Johannes Fabry[2] and the surgeon William Anderson[3] in 1898.[4]

Signs and symptoms

Symptoms are typically first experienced in early childhood and can be very difficult to diagnose; the rarity of Fabry disease to many clinicians sometimes leads to misdiagnoses. Manifestations of the disease usually increase in number and severity as an individual ages.[5]

Pain
Full-body or localized pain to the extremities (known as acroparesthesia) or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is common in patients with Fabry disease. This pain can increase over time. This acroparesthesia is believed to be related to the damage of peripheral nerve fibers that transmit pain. GI-tract pain is likely caused by accumulation of lipids in the small vasculature of the GI tract, which obstructs blood flow and causes pain.[6]

Kidney
Kidney complications are common and serious effects of the disease; chronic kidney disease and kidney failure may worsen throughout life. The presence of protein in the urine (which causes foamy urine) is often the first sign of kidney involvement. End-stage kidney failure in those with Fabry disease typically occurs in the third decade of life, and is a common cause of death due to the disease.[citation needed]

Heart
Fabry disease can affect the heart in several ways. The accumulation of sphingolipids within heart muscle cells causes abnormal thickening of the heart muscle or hypertrophy. This hypertrophy can cause the heart muscle to become abnormally stiff and unable to relax, leading to a restrictive cardiomyopathy causing shortness of breath.[7][8]

Fabry disease can also affect the way in which the heart conducts electrical impulses, leading to both abnormally slow heart rhythms such as complete heart block, and abnormally rapid heart rhythms such as ventricular tachycardia. These abnormal heart rhythms can cause blackouts, palpitations, or even sudden cardiac death.[7][8]

Sphingolipids can also build up within the heart valves, thickening the valves and affecting the way they open and close. If severe, this can cause the valves to leak (regurgitation) or to restrict the forward flow of blood (stenosis). The aortic and mitral valves are more commonly affected than the valves on the right side of the heart.[7][8]

Skin
Angiokeratomas (tiny, painless papules that can appear on any region of the body, but are predominant on the thighs, around the navel, buttocks, lower abdomen, and groin) are common.[9]

Anhidrosis (lack of sweating) is a common symptom, and less commonly hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).[citation needed]

Additionally, patients can exhibit Raynaud's disease-like symptoms with neuropathy (in particular, burning extremity pain).[citation needed]

Ocular involvement may be present showing cornea verticillata (also known as vortex keratopathy), i.e. clouding of the corneas. Keratopathy may be the presenting feature in asymptomatic patients, and must be differentiated from other causes of vortex keratopathy (e.g. drug deposition in the cornea).[10] This clouding does not affect vision.[10]

Other ocular findings can include conjunctival and retinal vascular abnormalities and anterior/posterior spoke-like cataract. Visual reduction from these manifestations is uncommon.[citation needed]

Other manifestations
Fatigue, neuropathy (in particular, burning extremity pain, red hands and feet on and off), cerebrovascular effects leading to an increased risk of stroke - early strokes, mostly vertebrobasilar system tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo, nausea, inability to gain weight, chemical imbalances, and diarrhea are other common symptoms.[citation needed]

Causes
Fabry disease is caused by a DNA sequence (gene) that is not functioning as it should. A person who inherits this gene does not have enough of a functioning enzyme known as alpha-galactosidase A. The lack of alpha-galactosidase leads to Fabry disease. A deficiency of alpha galactosidase A (a-GAL A, encoded by GLA) due to mutation causes a glycolipid known as globotriaosylceramide (abbreviated as Gb3, GL-3, or ceramide trihexoside) to accumulate within the blood vessels, other tissues, and organs.[11] This accumulation leads to an impairment of their proper functions.[citation needed]

At least 443 disease-causing mutations in the GLA gene have been discovered.[12] The DNA mutations that cause the disease are X-linked recessive with incomplete penetrance in heterozygous females. The condition affects hemizygous males (i.e. all non-intersex males), as well as homozygous, and in many cases heterozygous females. While males typically experience severe symptoms, women can range from being asymptomatic to having severe symptoms. Research suggests many women experience severe symptoms ranging from early cataracts or strokes to hypertrophic left ventricular heart problems and kidney failure. This variability is thought to be due to X-inactivation patterns during embryonic development of the female.[13]

Mechanism
Fabry disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency is a result of an accumulation of glycosphingolipids found in the lysosomes and most cell types and tissues, which leads it to be considered a multisystem disease. Indications include painful crisis, angiokeratomas, corneal dystrophy, and hypohydrosis.[14] In severe cases there is renal, cerebrovascular, and cardiac involvement and it is predominately responsible for premature mortality in Fabry patients.[14] Fabry disease is X-linked and manifests mostly in homozygous males but also in heterozygous females. Cardiac involvement is recurrent in Fabry patients. Patients have developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and valvular abnormalities.[14] Deficient activity of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) within lysosomes, that is believed to trigger a cascade of cellular events.[15] The demonstration of marked alpha-galactosidase deficiency is the conclusive method for the diagnosis in homozygous males. It may be detected in heterozygotous females, but it is often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation, so molecular testing (genotyping) of females is mandatory.[15]

Diagnosis
Fabry disease is suspected based on the individual's clinical presentation, and can be diagnosed by an enzyme assay (usually done on leukocytes) to measure the level of alpha-galactosidase activity. An enzyme assay is not reliable for the diagnosis of disease in females due to the random nature of X-inactivation. Molecular genetic analysis of the GLA gene is the most accurate method of diagnosis in females, particularly if the mutations have already been identified in male family members. Many disease-causing mutations have been noted. Kidney biopsy may also be suggestive of Fabry disease if excessive lipid buildup is noted. Pediatricians, as well as internists, commonly misdiagnose Fabry disease.[16] All immediate and extended family members in the same family have the same family mutation, so if one member of a family has a DNA sequence analysis performed, other members of the family can be diagnosed by performing a targeted sequence analysis instead of testing the entire gene.[17] Targeted sequencing is quicker and less expensive to perform. One study reported that for every first diagnosis in a family, on average five more family members (immediate and extended) are also diagnosed.[17]

MRI is accurate in accessing left ventricular mass and thickness and hypertrophy. Late gadolinium enhancement shows increased signal of the midwall at the inferolateral wall of the base of the left ventricle, usually in the non-hypertrophic ventricle. T1-weighted imaging can show low T1 signal due to sphingolipid storage in the heart even without ventricular hypertrophy in 40% of the those affected by the disease. Thus, MRI is a useful way of diagnosing the disease early.[18] T2 signal is increased in inflammation and oedema.[19]

Treatment
The treatments available for Fabry disease can be divided into therapies that aim to correct the underlying problem of decreased activity of the alpha galactosidase A enzyme and thereby reduce the risk of organ damage, and therapies to improve symptoms and life expectancy once organ damage has already occurred.[citation needed]

Therapies targeting enzyme activity
Enzyme replacement therapy is designed to provide the enzyme the patient is missing as a result of a genetic malfunction. This treatment is not a cure, but can partially prevent disease progression, and potentially reverse some symptoms.[20] As of March 2022, two medical drugs based on enzyme replacement therapy are available for Fabry disease:
Agalsidase alfa, sold under the brand name Replagal by the company Takeda (since its acquisition of the company Shire), is a recombinant form of alpha-galactosidase A[21] It received approval in the EU in 2001.[22] FDA approval was applied for the United States.[23] However, Shire withdrew their application for approval in the United States in 2012, citing that the agency will require additional clinical trials before approval.[24] As of March 2022, Replagal has not received FDA approval.[25]
Agalsidase beta, sold under the brand name Fabrazyme by the company Sanofi Genzyme, is another recombinant form of alpha-galactosidase. Like replagal, it received approval in the EU in 2001.[26] In 2003, it was the first treatment for Fabry disease to be approved by the FDA.[27]
Clinically, the two treatments are generally similar in effectiveness and safety,[28] however they have never been compared directly in a randomized trial.[29] Both are given by intravenous infusion every two weeks.[22][26] They are available in Europe and in many other parts of the world, but treatment costs remain very high.[30]
Pharmacological chaperone therapy is another strategy to maintain enzyme activity. It does so by assisting correct folding of alpha-galactosidase despite the mutations that cause Fabry disease. As of March 2022, one medical drug based on pharmacological chaperone therapy is available for Fabry disease:
Migalastat, sold under the brand name Galafold by the company Amicus Therapeutics, is a pharmacological chaperone that can stabilize many mutant forms of alpha-galactosidase. It is taken by mouth. In a randomized trial comparing Migalastat with enzyme replacement therapy, the efficacy and safety of both treatments were similar.[31][32] The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Galafold orphan drug status in 2004,[33] and the European Commission followed in 2006.[34] The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted the drug a marketing approval under the name Galafold in May 2016.[35][36][37] FDA approval followed in 2018.[38]
Experimental therapies that are currently not approved for treatment as of March 2022 include the following:
A gene therapy treatment that is in early-phase clinical trials,[39][40] with the technology licensed to AvroBio.[41]
Plant-based ERT (pegunigalsidase alfa) under development by the company Protalix
The substrate reduction therapy Venglustat (Ibiglustat) under development by Sanofi-Genzyme[42]
Bio-better ERT (CDX-6311) under pre-clinical development by the company Codexis
A gene therapy (ST-920) under development by the company Sangamo.[43]
Organ-specific treatment
Pain associated with Fabry disease may be partially alleviated by enzyme replacement therapy in some patients, but pain management regimens may also include analgesics, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, though the latter are usually best avoided in kidney disease. The kidney failure seen in some of those with Fabry disease sometimes requires haemodialysis. The cardiac complications of Fabry disease include abnormal heart rhythms, which may require a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, while the restrictive cardiomyopathy often seen may require diuretics.[20]

Prognosis
Life expectancy with Fabry disease for males was 58.2 years, compared with 74.7 years in the general population, and for females 75.4 years compared with 80.0 years in the general population, according to registry data from 2001 to 2008. The most common cause of death was cardiovascular disease, and most of those had received kidney replacements.[44]

Epidemiology
Fabry disease is panethnic, but due to its rarity, determining an accurate disease frequency is difficult.[15] Reported incidences, ranging from one in 476,000 to one in 117,000 in the general population, may largely underestimate the true prevalence.[15] Newborn screening initiatives have found an unexpectedly high prevalence of the disease, as high as one in about 3,100 newborns in Italy and have identified a surprisingly high frequency of newborn males around one in 1,500 in Taiwan.[15]

Research
Enzyme replacement therapy: Replacement of the missing enzyme to clear the lipids (GL-3) from the cells[17]
Substrate synthesis inhibition, also called substrate reduction therapy: Inhibits the production of the lipid (GL-3) that accumulates in the cells[17]
Chaperone therapy: Uses small-molecule drugs that bind to the defective enzyme and stabilize it to increase enzyme activity and increase cellular function[17]
Gene editing: Technology that can potentially cut and fix a broken gene in a cell[17]
Gene therapy: Genetically modifies the affected cells to produce the missing enzyme.[17]
History
Fabry disease was first described by dermatologist Johannes Fabry[2] and surgeon William Anderson[3] independently in 1898.[4] It was recognised to be due to abnormal storage of lipids in 1952. In the 1960s, the inheritance pattern was established as being X-linked, as well as the molecular defect responsible for causing the accumulation of glycolipids.[4]

Ken Hashimoto published his classic paper on his electron microscopic findings in Fabry disease in 1965.[45][46]

28,"            Acute-onset arthritis is a common clinical problem facing both the general clinician and the rheumatologist. A viral aetiology is though to be responsible for approximately 1% of all cases of acute arthritis with a wide range of causal agents recognised. The epidemiology of acute viral arthritis continues to evolve, with some aetiologies, such as rubella, becoming less common due to vaccination, while some vector-borne viruses have become more widespread. A travel history therefore forms an important part of the assessment of patients presenting with an acute arthritis. Worldwide, parvovirus B19, hepatitis B and C, HIV and the alphaviruses are among the most important causes of virally mediated arthritis. Targeted serological testing may be of value in establishing a diagnosis, and clinicians must also be aware that low-titre autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody, can occur in the context of acute viral arthritis. A careful consideration of epidemiological, clinical and serological features is therefore required to guide clinicians in making diagnostic and treatment decisions. While most virally mediated arthritides are self-limiting some warrant the initiation of specific antiviral therapy.     ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27037381/,Arthritis,Viral arthritis
29,"            Early undifferentiated arthritis is a group of inflammatory joint disease of less than 3 months duration that do not classify under any of the specific rheumatic or connective tissue disorder. Previously, inflammatory arthritis used to be treated only when there was a clear evidence of damage or deformity occurring with it. Use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were considered potentially harmful early in the course of arthritis which could be self-limiting. However, with the abundance of data on outcomes of early arthritis and identification of factors that can help to predict those outcomes lead to earlier use of such DMARDs. Better understanding of serological tests like anti-CCP antibodies and imaging modalities like high frequency ultrasound with power doppler and magnetic resonance imaging has increased the diagnostic and prognostic yield of such early arthritis cases. It is now imperative that the risk be assessed early in the course of disease and early DMARDs be instituted for better outcome in these cases. This review analyses the historical evolution of evidence in the management of early undifferentiated arthritis and summarises the treatment approach, monitoring and disease outcomes till date.

30,"            Chronic inflammatory arthritides in children include a wide range of various diseases. One of the main concerns of physicians who treat these disorders is the risk of permanent physical disability resulting from joint damage. Actual classification relies mainly on clinical features, particularly the number of joints affected at onset, although the general feeling is that chronic childhood arthritis exists in many different entities gathered together under the common names juvenile chronic arthritis or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The past 2 years were rather fertile in debates for proposing a progression for more objectivity in nomenclature, which was the theme of the Pediatric Rheumatology Study Group session at the American College of Rheumatology annual meeting held in Atlanta in 1992. The viewpoints from North America and Europe addressed at this meeting were published in a supplement of the Journal of Rheumatology in 1993. A debate on this topic was also organized at the International League Against Rheumatism Congress held in Barcelona in 1993. At present, the main criteria rely on clinical experience and natural history of the diseases and on biology and immunogenetics. Another important concern among pediatric rheumatologists is efficacy of treatment. Questions include, ""Are we doing enough?"" and ""How safe are the therapeutic strategies?"" In this review some of the recent studies that may be important for classification and nomenclature and therapy and management are discussed.

31,"            Arthritides tend to move in the classification flow sheet in a characteristic way: inflammatory--reactive--postinfectious--infective. A distinction between reactive and postinfective arthritis is rarely made in clinical practice and does not have therapeutic implications. In Finland, they are routinely lumped together and termed reactive arthritis (ReA). Native or modified HLA-B27 molecules may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of ReA, perhaps as targets for cytotoxic cells. Individuals with inadvertently strong non-specific inflammatory responses may be particularly disease-prone. The occurrence of different ensuing triggering infections in individual patients further confirms the idea that activation of the immune response and the immunogenetic make-up rather than the type and location of causative microbes as such are relevant. It is also possible that antigen processing of several microbe species of different types ends up with identical cross-reactive epitopes to be presented. It has been and certainly will to an increasing extent be reported that microbial antigens can be demonstrated in the diseased joints. It is assumed that they are involved in the local immune-inflammatory response manifesting clinically as arthritis. It has been shown that the cellular arm of the immune response is activated and for example that most of the local CD4 lymphocytes of chronic arthritides belong to the CDw29 helper-inducer memory cell subset, perhaps responding briskly to antigens originating from the triggering micro-organisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)    ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2701288/,Arthritis,Reactive arthritis: an update
32,"          Background:                    Acute inflammatory arthritides can present as a result of immune reaction following infections. Post-infectious arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip in children are included in this disease entity. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical profiles of post-infectious arthritis and transient synovitis of the hip in Thai children.              Methods:                    A retrospective review was performed at a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand from January 2005 to July 2017.              Results:                    Eighty-six patients (56 boys and 30 girls) were included in this study. Mean age was 8.4 ± 4.8 years. Reactive arthritis was diagnosed in two patients (2.3%) following Salmonella spp. and Chlamydia trachomatis infections. Post-streptococcal reactive arthritis was present in 10 patients (11.6%). Transient synovitis of the hip was found in 30 patients (34.9%). Forty-four patients (51.2%) were clinically diagnosed with post-infectious arthritis. Mono/oligoarthritis was the most common clinical profile (84.9%). The distribution of lower-extremity involvement was as follows: hip, 47.6%; knee, 46.5%; and ankle joints, 30.2%. The documented preceding illness consisted mostly of upper respiratory tract symptoms (30.2%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed for 70 patients (81.4%).              Conclusion:                    Mono/oligoarthritis of the lower extremity was the main clinical profile. Preceding viral illness was documented in one-third of children.

33,"            This article outlines an approach to basic plain-film diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the arthritides. It advocates the use of an analysis of which part of the joint is involved, and works through a logical sequence to reach a final diagnosis. It recommends the concept of dividing up the arthritides into those in which the radiological effects predominantly affect synovium, cartilage or the enthesis.

34,"            Rheumatoid arthritis is the most commonly diagnosed systemic inflammatory arthritis. Women, smokers, and those with a family history of the disease are most often affected. Criteria for diagnosis include having at least one joint with definite swelling that is not explained by another disease. The likelihood of a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis increases with the number of small joints involved. In a patient with inflammatory arthritis, the presence of a rheumatoid factor or anti-citrullinated protein antibody, or elevated C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggests a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Initial laboratory evaluation should also include complete blood count with differential and assessment of renal and hepatic function. Patients taking biologic agents should be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. Earlier diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis allows for earlier treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic agents. Combinations of medications are often used to control the disease. Methotrexate is typically the first-line drug for rheumatoid arthritis. Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, are generally considered second-line agents or can be added for dual therapy. The goals of treatment include minimization of joint pain and swelling, prevention of radiographic damage and visible deformity, and continuation of work and personal activities. Joint replacement is indicated for patients with severe joint damage whose symptoms are poorly controlled by medical management.

35,"            Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, primarily affecting the joints, then extra-articular manifestations can occur. Due to its complexity, which is based on an incompletely elucidated pathophysiological mechanism, good RA management requires a multidisciplinary approach. The clinical status of RA patients has improved in recent years due to medical advances in diagnosis and treatment, that have made it possible to reduce disease activity and prevent systemic complications. The most promising results were obtained by developing disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the class to which conventional synthetic, biologic, and targeted synthetic drugs belong. Furthermore, ongoing drug development has led to obtaining molecules with improved efficacy and safety profiles, but further research is needed until RA turns into a curable pathology. In the present work, we offer a comprehensive perspective on the management of RA, by centralizing the existing data provided by significant literature, emphasizing the importance of an early and accurate diagnosis associated with optimal personalized treatment in order to achieve better outcomes for RA patients. In addition, this study suggests future research perspectives in the treatment of RA that could lead to higher efficacy and safety profiles and lower financial costs.

Methods:                    A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted according to Cochrane collaboration guidelines. The population of interest was adult patients with RA in remission or LDA. The reported outcomes of interest were any symptoms or burdens.              Results:                    Fifty-one publications were identified through an eDatabase search. Together with 17 articles found through other sources, 68 were included for full text review. The most commonly reported residual symptoms were pain (number of studies = 25), fatigue (n = 21) and morning stiffness (n = 5). Reported disease burdens included mental health (n = 15), sleep disturbances (n = 7) and work productivity (n = 5), impairment in quality of life (n = 21), and functional disability (n = 34). Substantial residual symptoms and disease burdens were found to be present in patients in remission or LDA.              Conclusion:                    This is the first SLR to investigate residual symptoms and disease burdens in RA patients in remission or LDA. The results indicate that despite achieving conventional clinical targets, the disease continues to affect patients, suggesting the existence of unmet need under the current treatment paradigm.

37,"            Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease of connective tissue with periods of exacerbation and remission. Fatigue is excessive strain throughout the body that is disproportionate or unrelated to an activity or lifestyle. Fatigue is an integral part of RA in most patients. The study aimed to assess the level of fatigue in RA patients and establish the relationship between fatigue and demographic and clinical factors. The study group consisted of 128 RA patients according to European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and -Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) vitality scores were used to assess the severity of fatigue symptoms. The analyzed variables were gender, age, disease duration, education, marital status, place of residence, work and residence status, pharmacological treatment, pain, morning stiffness, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), compression soreness, Richie Articular Index, and DAS28 disease activity. The examined patients experience chronic fatigue-the mean value on the FACIT-F scale was 24.1 ± 9.1 points and on the SF-36 Vitality score was 14.2 ± 1.8 points. There is a relationship between the level of fatigue and pain, long-lasting morning stiffness, active disease, increased soreness of joints, and low hemoglobin values. When analyzing the symptom of fatigue, each patient should be approached individually, using the existing questionnaires or asking key questions to recognize the situation. The presence of fatigue symptoms should be considered during therapy and patient care by searching for and eliminating additional, intensifying stimuli and increasing its level.

38,"            The 'life cycle' of established rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into four phases. The first is the period leading up to the onset of arthritis. The second is the period during which persistence or remission is determined. The third is the evolution into a specific form of inflammatory arthritis, and the fourth is the outcome/severity of that arthritis. In some patients, these four phases follow in rapid succession; however, in other patients, the time course is prolonged over several months or years. This chapter explores the hypothesis that these four phases are distinct in the majority of patients, and that different genetic and environmental factors influence the various phases. It investigates the suggestion that a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may underlie the persistence of inflammatory arthritis. It suggests that the term 'early rheumatoid arthritis' is not appropriate and that patients either have established rheumatoid arthritis or an undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.

39,"          Background:                    Up to 29% of patients with psoriasis seen by dermatologists have undiagnosed psoriatic arthritis (PsA). As early detection of PsA may be associated with improved joint and skin outcomes, it is essential for dermatologists to improve their ability to diagnose PsA. Skin and nail features of psoriasis associated with PsA are well known to dermatologists but they may feel less confortable assessing other symptoms and they rarely use PsA screening questionnaires.              Objective:                    To develop a limited list of clinical signs and symptoms that a dermatologist should be looking for in a psoriasis patient in addition to specific skin features and nail involvement, to improve PsA detection.              Methods:                    A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Cochrane and Embase databases to identify clinical key symptoms associated with PsA. It yielded 27 studies in which we extracted a list of clinical signs and symptoms observed in PsA and submitted it to a panel of dermatology experts through a DELPHI selection process. The experts had to determine which minimal set of signs and symptoms dermatologists should look for in daily practice to improve detection of PsA in patients with psoriasis.              Results:                    The four items that received a score higher than 90% in the DELPHI process were finally selected. Those items were as follows: peripheral inflammatory pain (100%), axial inflammatory pain (95.3%), dactylitis (93%), buttock and sciatic pain (90.7%). The remaining items: distal interphalangeal joints (DIPs) involvement (83.7%), Talalgia (79.1%), swollen Achille's tendon (41.9%), costo-chondral involvement (32.6%), uveitis (7%), mouth ulcerations (2.3%), were not retained.

40,"            Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic and widespread musculoskeletal pain, often accompanied by other symptoms, such as fatigue, intestinal disorders and alterations in sleep and mood. It is estimated that two to eight percent of the world population is affected by fibromyalgia. From a medical point of view, this pathology still presents inexplicable aspects. It is known that fibromyalgia is caused by a central sensitization phenomenon characterized by the dysfunction of neuro-circuits, which involves the perception, transmission and processing of afferent nociceptive stimuli, with the prevalent manifestation of pain at the level of the locomotor system. In recent years, the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia has also been linked to other factors, such as inflammatory, immune, endocrine, genetic and psychosocial factors. A rheumatologist typically makes a diagnosis of fibromyalgia when the patient describes a history of pain spreading in all quadrants of the body for at least three months and when pain is caused by digital pressure in at least 11 out of 18 allogenic points, called tender points. Fibromyalgia does not involve organic damage, and several diagnostic approaches have been developed in recent years, including the analysis of genetic, epigenetic and serological biomarkers. Symptoms often begin after physical or emotional trauma, but in many cases, there appears to be no obvious trigger. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men. Unfortunately, the conventional medical therapies that target this pathology produce limited benefits. They remain largely pharmacological in nature and tend to treat the symptomatic aspects of various disorders reported by the patient. The statistics, however, highlight the fact that 90% of people with fibromyalgia also turn to complementary medicine to manage their symptoms.

A 69-year-old male presented to our hospital complaining of a rash on his whole body, which resulted in a clinical diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Right ureteral cancer was suspected on computed tomographic CT examination during the investigation for the underlying malignancy. The patient was treated with prednisolone and right nephroureterectomy with bladder cuffing for dermatomyositis and ureteral cancer, respectively. One year after surgery, the dermatomyositis worsened, and CT examination showed local recurrence and lymph node metastasis. Chemotherapy was performed, and CT examination 3 months after treatment showed that the tumor had shrunk. Skin symptoms were also ameliorated. Chemotherapy was given intermittently thereafter. The tumor then increased and skin symptoms reappeared ; 3 years after surgery the patient's general condition deteriorated, resulting in death. Ureteral cancer with dermatomyositis is rare, but dermatomyositis complicated with malignancy has a poor prognosis. Careful whole body search may be useful for early detection of malignancy.

42,"            Primary erythromelalgia (PE ORPHA90026) is a rare autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by the combination of recurrent burning pain, warmth and redness of the extremities. The incidence rate of PE ranges from 0.36 to 1.1 per 100,000 persons. Gender ratio differs according to different studies and no evidence showed a gender preference. Clinical onset of PE is often in the first decade of life. Burning pain is the most predominant symptom and is usually caused and precipitated by warmth and physical activities. Reported cases of PE contain both inherited and sporadic forms. Genetic etiology of PE is mutations on SCN9A, the encoding gene of a voltage-gated sodium channel subtype Nav1.7. Diagnosis of PE is made upon clinical manifestations and screening for mutations on SCN9A. Exclusion of several other treatable diseases/secondary erythromelalgia is also necessary because of the lack of biomarkers specifically for PE. Differential diagnoses can include Fabry disease, cellulites, Raynaud phenomenon, vasculitis and so on. Diagnostic methods often involve complete blood count, imaging studies and thermograph. Treatment for PE is unsatisfactory and highly individualized. Frequently used pain relieving drugs involve sodium channel blockers such as lidocaine, carbamazepine and mexiletine. Novel drugs such as PF-05089771 and TV-45070 could be promising in ameliorating pain symptoms due to their Nav1.7 selectivity. Patients' symptoms often worsen over time and many patients develop ulcerations and gangrenes caused by excessive exposure to low temperature in order to relieve pain. This review mainly focuses on PE and the causative gene SCN9A--its mutations and their effects on Nav1.7 channels' electrophysiological properties. We propose a genotype-channelopathy-phenotype correlation network underlying PE etiology which could provide guidance for future therapeutics.

43,"          Disease overview:                    Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation that is often but not always accompanied by JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations. Additional disease features include bone marrow reticulin/collagen fibrosis, aberrant inflammatory cytokine expression, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), constitutional symptoms, cachexia, leukemic progression, and shortened survival.              Diagnosis:                    Bone marrow morphology is the primary basis for diagnosis. Presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation, expected in around 90% of the patients, is supportive but not essential for diagnosis; these mutations are also prevalent in the closely related MPNs, namely polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The 2016 World Health Organization classification system distinguishes ""prefibrotic"" from ""overtly fibrotic"" PMF; the former might mimic ET in its presentation. Furthermore, approximately 15% of patients with ET or PV might progress into a PMF-like phenotype (post-ET/PV MF) during their clinical course.              Adverse mutations:                    SRSF2, ASXL1, and U2AF1-Q157 mutations predict inferior survival in PMF, independent of each other and other risk factors. RAS/CBL mutations predicted resistance to ruxolitinib therapy.              Adverse karyotype:                    Very high risk abnormalities include -7, inv (3), i(17q), +21, +19, 12p-, and 11q-.              Risk stratification:                    Two new prognostic systems for PMF have recently been introduced: GIPSS (genetically-inspired prognostic scoring system) and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 (MIPSSv2; mutation- and karyotype-enhanced international prognostic scoring system). GIPSS is based exclusively on mutations and karyotype. MIPSSv2 includes, in addition, clinical risk factors. GIPSS features four and MIPSSv2 five risk categories.              Risk-adapted therapy:                    Observation alone is advised for MIPSSv2 ""low"" and ""very low"" risk disease (estimated 10-year survival 56%-92%); allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) is the preferred treatment for ""very high"" and ""high"" risk disease (estimated 10-year survival 0%-13%); treatment-requiring patients with intermediate-risk disease (estimated 10-year survival 30%) are best served by participating in clinical trials. In non-transplant candidates, conventional treatment for anemia includes androgens, prednisone, thalidomide, and danazol; for symptomatic splenomegaly, hydroxyurea and ruxolitinib; and for constitutional symptoms, ruxolitinib. Fedratinib, another JAK2 inhibitor, has now been FDA-approved for use in ruxolitinib failures. Splenectomy is considered for drug-refractory splenomegaly and involved field radiotherapy for non-hepatosplenic EMH and extremity bone pain.              New directions:                    A number of new agents, alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, are currently under investigation for MF treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov); preliminary results from some of these clinical trials were presented at the 2020 ASH annual meeting and highlighted in the current document.

This approach provides descriptive information about the blast cells that is useful for disease monitoring, provides clues to pathogenesis, and can help clinicians select effective chemotherapeutic regimens. Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALALs) are those leukemias that either fail to show evidence of myeloid, B-, or T-lymphoid lineage commitment or show evidence of commitment to more than 1 lineage. The different treatment regimens for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) make ALAL a challenge both diagnostically and therapeutically.              Methods:                    Current classification criteria have reduced the reported incidence of mixed-lineage leukemias by emphasizing fewer markers and categorizing some biphenotypic leukemias with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities as other entities. Several recent studies have explored the genomic and epigenetic landscape of mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) and have suggested a further refinement of the World Health Organization classification to emphasize the genomic heterogeneity of MPAL.              Results:                    Genomic and expression profile data for MPAL reveal mutations commonly seen in both AML and ALL, with T-/myeloid MPAL showing overlapping features with early T-cell precursor lymphoblastic leukemia.

46,"            Hyaline cartilages, fibrocartilages and elastic cartilages play multiple roles in the human body including bearing loads in articular joints and intervertebral discs, providing joint lubrication, forming the external ears and nose, supporting the trachea, and forming the long bones during development and growth. The structure and organization of cartilage's extracellular matrix (ECM) are the primary determinants of normal function. Most diseases involving cartilage lead to dramatic changes in the ECM which can govern disease progression (e.g., in osteoarthritis), cause the main symptoms of the disease (e.g., dwarfism caused by genetically inherited mutations) or occur as collateral damage in pathological processes occurring in other nearby tissues (e.g., osteochondritis dissecans and inflammatory arthropathies). Challenges associated with cartilage diseases include poor understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis, delayed diagnoses due to the aneural nature of the tissue and drug delivery challenges due to the avascular nature of adult cartilages. This narrative review provides an overview of the clinical and pathological features as well as current treatment options available for various cartilage diseases.

47,"            Cirrhosis is the 12th leading cause of death in the United States. Newer research has established that liver fibrosis is a dynamic process and that early cirrhosis may be reversible. Only one in three people with cirrhosis knows they have it. Most patients with cirrhosis remain asymptomatic until the onset of decompensation. When clinical signs, symptoms, or abnormal liver function tests are discovered, further evaluation should be pursued promptly. The most common causes of cirrhosis are viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Initial workup includes viral hepatitis serologies, ferritin, transferrin saturation, and abdominal ultrasonography as well as complete blood count, liver function tests, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, if not already ordered. Additional testing is based on demographics and risk factors. Common serum and ultrasound-based screening tests to assess fibrosis include the aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index score, Fibrosis 4 score, FibroTest/FibroSure, nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score, standard ultrasonography, and transient elastography. Generally, noninvasive tests are most useful in identifying patients with no to minimal fibrosis or advanced fibrosis. Chronic liver disease management includes directed counseling, laboratory testing, and ultrasound monitoring. Treatment goals are preventing cirrhosis, decompensation, and death. Varices are monitored with endoscopy and often require prophylaxis with nonselective beta blockers. Ascites treatment includes diuresis, salt restriction, and antibiotic prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, when indicated. Hepatic encephalopathy is managed with lifestyle and nutritional modifications and, as needed, with lactulose and rifaximin. Hepatocellular carcinoma screening includes ultrasound screening every six months for patients with cirrhosis.

However, cirrhosis can eventually lead to liver failure, and you can get serious complications, which can be life threatening.Treatment may be able to stop cirrhosis from getting worse.Symptoms of cirrhosisYou may not have any symptoms during the early stages of cirrhosis.As your liver becomes more damaged, you may:feel very tired and weakfeel sick (nausea)lose your appetitelose weight and muscle massget red patches on your palms and small, spider-like blood vessels on your skin (spider angiomas) above waist levelIf cirrhosis gets worse, some of the symptoms and complications include:yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)vomiting blooditchy skindark pee and tarry-looking poobleeding or bruising easilyswollen legs (oedema) or tummy (ascites) from a build-up of fluidloss of sex drive (libido)See a GP if you think you may have cirrhosis.Diagnosing cirrhosisIf a GP suspects cirrhosis, they'll check your medical history and do a physical examination to look for signs of long-term liver disease.You may have tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as:blood testsscans, such as an ultrasound, CT, MRI, or transient elastography scana liver biopsy, were a fine needle is used to remove a sample of liver cells so they can be examined under a microscopeIf tests show that you have cirrhosis, a GP should refer you to see a doctor who specialises in liver problems (hepatologist).If you have complications from cirrhosis, or a high chance of getting complications, you may be referred to a specialist liver centre.Treating cirrhosisThere's no cure for cirrhosis at the moment. However, there are ways to manage the symptoms and any complications and slow its progression.Treating the problem that led to cirrhosis (for example, using anti-viral medicines to treat hepatitis C) can stop cirrhosis getting worse.You may be advised to cut down or stop drinking alcohol, or to lose weight if you're overweight. A GP can help you get support if you need help to stop drinking or to lose weight.If your liver is severely damaged, a liver transplant may be the only treatment option.What causes cirrhosisIn the UK, the most common causes of cirrhosis are:drinking too much alcohol over many yearsbeing infected with hepatitis for a long time, particularly hepatitis B or hepatitis Ca severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, where the liver becomes inflamed from a build-up of excess fatCirrhosis can also be caused by a problem affecting your bile ducts (such as primary biliary cholangitis) or immune system (such as autoimmune hepatitis), some inherited conditions, and the long-term use of certain medicines.Alcohol-related liver diseaseDrinking too much alcohol damages the liver. Over time, this can lead to alcohol-related liver disease.Cirrhosis is the final stage of alcohol-related liver disease. It usually happens after many years of heavy drinking.How to prevent cirrhosisLimit alcoholThe best way to prevent alcohol-related cirrhosis is to drink within the recommended limits.The guidelines recommend:men and women should not regularly drink more than 14 units of alcohol a weekyou should spread your drinking over 3 days, or more, if you drink as much as 14 units a weekStop drinking alcohol immediately if you have alcohol-related cirrhosis. Drinking alcohol speeds up the rate at which cirrhosis progresses, regardless of the cause.A GP can offer help and advice if you're finding it difficult to cut down the amount you drink. Read more about where to get alcohol support.Protect yourself from hepatitisHepatitis B and C are infections in the liver caused by a virus.The hepatitis B virus is spread in blood and body fluids. The hepatitis C virus is usually spread in blood.Common ways of spreading these viruses include having sex with an infected person without using a condom, or close contact with an infected person's blood, such as sharing their toothbrush or sharing needles to inject drugs.Vaccination for hepatitis B is part of the NHS childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is also available to anyone who has an increased chance of getting hepatitis B.There is no vaccine for hepatitis C at the moment.Aim for a healthy weightTo reduce your chance of getting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can lead to cirrhosis, make sure you're a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly.The liverThe liver is an important organ that does hundreds of jobs that are vital for sustaining life.For example, the liver:stores glycogen, a type of fuel the body needs for energymakes bile, which helps us digest fatsmakes substances that help blood to clot and repair damaged tissuesprocesses and removes alcohol, toxins or medicines from the bloodhelps the body fight infectionsYour liver is very tough. It'll keep working even when it's damaged and can continue to repair itself until it's severely damaged.Video: cirrhosis - Phil's storyIn this video, Phil talks about why he was shocked to discover he had cirrhosis.

49,"            Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric complication of cirrhosis and/or porto-systemic shunting. The clinical symptoms are widely variable, extending from subtle impairment in mental state to coma. The utility of categorizing the severity of HE accurately and efficiently serves not only to provide practical functional information about the current clinical status of the patient but also gives valuable prognostic information. In the past 20-30 years, there has been rapid progress in understanding the pathophysiological basis of HE; however, the lack of direct correlation between pathogenic factors and the severity of HE make it difficult to select appropriate therapy for HE patients. In this review, we will discuss the classification system and its limitations, the neuropsychometric assessments and their challenges, as well as the present knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms. Despite the many prevalent hypotheses around the pathogenesis of the disease, most treatments focus on targeting and lowering the accumulation of ammonia as well as inflammation. However, treatment of minimal HE remains a huge unmet need and a big concerted effort is needed to better define this condition to allow the development of new therapies. We review the currently available therapies and future approaches to treat HE as well as the scientific and clinical data that support their effectiveness.

50,"          Background:                    Cirrhosis is increasingly common and morbid. Optimal utilisation of therapeutic strategies to prevent and control the complications of cirrhosis are central to improving clinical and patient-reported outcomes.              Methods:                    We conducted a narrative review of the literature focusing on the most recent advances.              Results:                    We review the aetiology-focused therapies that can prevent cirrhosis and its complications. These include anti-viral therapies, psychopharmacological therapy for alcohol-use disorder, and the current landscape of clinical trials for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. We review the current standard of care and latest developments in the management of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites and hepatorenal syndrome. We evaluate the promise and drawbacks of chemopreventative therapies that have been examined in trials and observational studies which may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis complications. Finally, we examine the therapies which address the non-pain symptoms of cirrhosis including pruritis, muscle cramps, sexual dysfunction and fatigue.              Conclusion:                    The improvement of clinical and patient-reported outcomes for patients with cirrhosis is possible by applying evidence-based pharmacotherapeutic approaches to the prevention and treatment of cirrhosis complications.

52,"            Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a prevalent condition affecting about one in 100 patients attending primary care. There is no diagnostic test, validated biomarker, clear pathophysiology or curative treatment. The core symptom of fatigue affects both physical and cognitive activities, and features a prolonged post-activity exacerbation triggered by tasks previously achieved without difficulty. Although several different diagnostic criteria are proposed, for clinical purposes only three elements are required: recognition of the typical fatigue; history and physical examination to exclude other medical or psychiatric conditions which may explain the symptoms; and a restricted set of laboratory investigations. Studies of the underlying pathophysiology clearly implicate a range of different acute infections as a trigger for onset in a significant minority of cases, but no other medical or psychological factor has been reproducibly implicated. There have been numerous small case-control studies seeking to identify the biological basis of the condition. These studies have largely resolved what the condition is not: ongoing infection, immunological disorder, endocrine disorder, primary sleep disorder, or simply attributable to a psychiatric condition. A growing body of evidence suggests CFS arises from functional (non-structural) changes in the brain, but of uncertain character and location. Further functional neuroimaging studies are needed. There is clear evidence for a genetic contribution to CFS from family and twin studies, suggesting that a large scale genome-wide association study is warranted. Despite the many unknowns in relation to CFS, there is significant room for improvement in provision of the diagnosis and supportive care. This may be facilitated via clinician education.

53,"            Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is defined by a profound, debilitating fatigue, lasting for at least 6 months and resulting in a substantial reduction of occupational, personal, social and educational status. CFS is a relatively poorly recognized clinical entity, although everyday experience shows that there are many patients with CFS symptoms. The incidence and prevalence of CFS remain unknown in most countries; however, the working population is most affected with predominantly female patients in generative period. Although, CFS was first mentioned four centuries ago, mysterious aethiopathogensis of CFS still intrigues scientists as hundreds of studies are still published every year on the subject. About 80 different aetiological CFS factors are mentioned, which can be classified into five basic groups: genetics, immunology, infectious diseases, endocrinology and neuropsychiatry-psychology. Even today the condition is passed established based on the diagnosis by exclusion of organic and psychiatric disorders, which demands a multidisciplinary approach. As the syndrome is often misdiagnosed and mistreated, self-medication is not uncommon in CFS patients'. In addition, such patients usually suffer for years tolerating severe fatigue. Thus, at the moment there are three priorities regarding CFS; understanding pathogenesis, development of diagnostic tests and creating efficient treatment program.

54,"            Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an illness characterized by disabling fatigue of at least 6 months. The aetiology of the condition has been hotly debated. In this chapter the evidence for CFS as a post viral condition and/or a neurological condition is reviewed. Although there is evidence that CFS is triggered by certain viruses in some patients and that neurobiological changes such as hypocortisolism are associated with the syndrome, neither mechanism is sufficient to explain the extent of the symptoms or disability experienced by patients. It is unlikely that CFS can be understood through one aetiological mechanisms. Rather it is a complex illness which is best explained in terms of a multifactorial cognitive behavioural model. This model proposes that CFS is precipitated by life events and/or viral illness in vulnerable individuals, such as those who are genetically predisposed, prone to distress, high achievement, and over or under activity. A self perpetuating cycle where physiological changes, illness beliefs, reduced and inconsistent activity, sleep disturbance, medical uncertainty and lack of guidance interact to maintain symptoms. Treatments based on this model including cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy are effective at significantly reducing fatigue and disability in CFS. This chapter provides a description of these approaches and details of the trials conducted in the area.

55,"            New insights into the phenotype of Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-hypermobile type (hEDS) have raised many issues in relation to classification, diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Within the multidisciplinary team, physical therapy plays a central role in management of individuals with hypermobility related disorders. However, many physical therapists are not familiar with the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, common clinical presentation, and management. This guideline aims to provide practitioners with the state of the art regarding the assessment and management of children, adolescents, and adults with JHS/hEDS. Due to the complexity of the symptoms in the profile of JHS/hEDS, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is adopted as a central framework whereby the umbrella term of disability is used to encompass functions, activities and participation, as well as environmental and personal factors. The current evidence-based literature regarding the management of JHS/hEDS is limited in size and quality and there is insufficient research exploring the clinical outcomes of a number of interventions. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions for children and adults. Until further multicenter trials are conducted, clinical decision-making should be based on theoretical and the current limited research evidence. For all individuals diagnosed with JHS/hEDS, international consensus and combined efforts to identify risk profiles would create a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms and the potential for optimizing health care for affected individuals. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

56,"What is fibromyalgia?Fibromyalgia is chronic condition that causes pain all over the body, fatigue, and other symptoms. People with fibromyalgia may be more sensitive to pain than people who don't have it. This is called abnormal pain perception processing.What causes fibromyalgia?The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Researchers think that certain things might contribute to its cause:Stressful or traumatic events, such as car accidentsRepetitive injuriesIllnesses such as viral infectionsSometimes, fibromyalgia can develop on its own. It can run in families, so genes may play a role in the cause.Who is at risk for fibromyalgia?Anyone can get fibromyalgia, but it is more common in:Women; they are twice as likely to have fibromyalgiaMiddle-aged peoplePeople with certain diseases, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or ankylosing spondylitisPeople who have a family member with fibromyalgiaWhat are the symptoms of fibromyalgia?Common symptoms of fibromyalgia include:Pain and stiffness all over the bodyFatigue and tirednessProblems with thinking, memory, and concentration (sometimes called ""fibro fog"")Depression and anxietyHeadaches, including migrainesIrritable bowel syndromeNumbness or tingling in the hands and feetPain in the face or jaw, including disorders of the jaw know as temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ)Sleep problemsHow is fibromyalgia diagnosed?Fibromyalgia can be hard to diagnose. It sometimes takes visits to several different health care providers to get a diagnosis. One problem is that there isn't a specific test for it. And the main symptoms, pain and fatigue, are common in many other conditions. Health care providers have to rule out other causes of the symptoms before making a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. This is called making a differential diagnosis.TYour health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:A medical history, including asking detailed questions about your symptomsA physical examX-rays and blood tests to rule out other conditionsThe guidelines for diagnosing fibromyalgia, which includeA history of widespread pain lasting more than 3 monthsPhysical symptoms including fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and cognitive (memory or thought) problemsThe number of areas throughout the body in which you had pain in the past weekWhat are the treatments for fibromyalgia?Not all health care providers are familiar with fibromyalgia and its treatment. You should see a doctor or team of health care providers who specialize in the treatment of fibromyalgia.Fibromyalgia is treated with a combination of treatments, which may include medicines, lifestyle changes, talk therapy, and complementary therapies:MedicinesOver-the-counter pain relieversPrescription medicines that were specifically approved to treat fibromyalgiaPrescription pain medicinesCertain antidepressants, which may help with pain or sleep problemsLifestyle changesGetting enough sleepGetting regular physical activity. If you have not already been active, start slowly and gradually increase how much activity you get. You may want to see a physical therapist, who can help you create a plan that is right for you.Learning how to manage stressEating a healthy dietLearning to pace yourself. If you do too much, it can make your symptoms worse. So you need to learn to balance being active with your need for rest.Talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help you learn strategies to deal with pain, stress, and negative thoughts. If you also have depression along with your fibromyalgia, talk therapy can help with that too.Complementary therapies have helped some people with the symptoms of fibromyalgia. But researchers need to do more studies to show which ones are effective. You could consider trying them, but you should check with your health care provider first.

57,"PrintOverviewFibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain and spinal cord process painful and nonpainful signals.Symptoms often begin after an event, such as physical trauma, surgery, infection or significant psychological stress. In other cases, symptoms gradually accumulate over time with no single triggering event.Women are more likely to develop fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have tension headaches, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety and depression.While there is no cure for fibromyalgia, a variety of medications can help control symptoms. Exercise, relaxation and stress-reduction measures also may help.Products & ServicesBook: Mayo Clinic Guide to FibromyalgiaBook: Mayo Clinic Guide to Pain ReliefShow more products from Mayo ClinicSymptomsThe primary symptoms of fibromyalgia include:Widespread pain. The pain associated with fibromyalgia often is described as a constant dull ache that has lasted for at least three months. To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist.Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea.Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as ""fibro fog"" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks.Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other conditions, such as:Irritable bowel syndromeChronic fatigue syndromeMigraine and other types of headachesInterstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndromeTemporomandibular joint disordersAnxietyDepressionPostural tachycardia syndrome                             CausesMany researchers believe that repeated nerve stimulation causes the brain and spinal cord of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain.In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become sensitized, meaning they can overreact to painful and nonpainful signals.There are likely many factors that lead to these changes, including:Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder.Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia.Physical or emotional events. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical event, such as a car accident. Prolonged psychological stress may also trigger the condition.Risk factorsRisk factors for fibromyalgia include:Your sex. Fibromyalgia is diagnosed more often in women than in men.Family history. You may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia if a parent or sibling also has the condition.Other disorders. If you have osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you may be more likely to develop fibromyalgia.ComplicationsThe pain, fatigue, and poor sleep quality associated with fibromyalgia can interfere with your ability to function at home or on the job. The frustration of dealing with an often-misunderstood condition also can result in depression and health-related anxiety.More InformationFibromyalgia and acupunctureBy Mayo Clinic StaffRequest an Appointment at Mayo ClinicDiagnosis & treatment    Oct. 26, 2021Print Share on: FacebookTwitterShow referencesFibromyalgia.

58,"Would acupuncture help lessen my fibromyalgia symptoms? Answer From Brent A. Bauer, M.D.Acupuncture appears to modestly reduce many types of chronic pain, so it's not surprising that many people with fibromyalgia are interested in trying it. While the studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture for fibromyalgia symptoms are somewhat mixed, most suggest that it may have a beneficial role.Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles to various depths into strategic points on your body. They are usually left in place for 20 to 30 minutes and sometimes are further stimulated by the addition of heat or electricity. When performed by a trained practitioner, acupuncture has few risks.Fibromyalgia can be difficult to treat, and a combination of treatments may be necessary to control your symptoms. If you're having trouble finding relief for your fibromyalgia pain, it may be worth trying acupuncture. But if your symptoms don't begin to improve within 6 to 8 weeks, acupuncture may not be the right treatment for you.With Brent A.

But there is research that points to several factors that may be involved. The research also includes risk factors that may increase a person’s chance of developing the condition.Read more: Everything you need to know about fibromyalgia »Symptoms of fibromyalgiaThere are several symptoms of fibromyalgia. These include:dull, aching pain on both sides of your body and above and below your waistfatiguetrouble remembering and concentrating, sometimes called “fibro fog”trouble sleepingheadachesjaw pain or clickingdepression and anxietydiarrhea and abdominal painpainful menstrual periodsnumbness or tingling in the hands and feetsensitivity to noise, light, or temperatures (hot or cold)Read more: Fibromyalgia symptoms »Causes of fibromyalgiaExperts don’t know exactly what causes fibromyalgia, but a few factors might be involved:Abnormal pain signalingIn people with fibromyalgia, the nervous system may not process pain signals in the usual way. Abnormal levels of chemicals in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves that carry these signals may make people more sensitive to the feeling of pain.Hormone imbalancesHormones such as serotonin, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and dopamine help your body to process pain. Lower-than-normal levels of these hormones in the brain and nervous system may interrupt pain signals and intensify your sensitivity to them.CytokinesIL-6 and IL-8 are cytokines, which are substances secreted by cells in the immune system. These particular molecules play a role in inflammation, and have been found to be associated with fibromyalgia.GeneticsFibromyalgia can run in families. It’s likely that there’s an unidentified genetic abnormality that increases certain people’s risk for the condition. Certain genes may control the way the body regulates pain responses.Scientists speculate that people with fibromyalgia carry one or more genes that cause them to react strongly to stimuli that another person may not perceive as painful.TriggersFor many people, symptoms begin after emotional or physical trauma, or a bout with an infectious disease. These factors do not likely cause fibromyalgia by themselves. However, they may trigger the onset in people who are already at risk for it by altering the nervous system’s response to pain.The following may also be fibromyalgia triggers:infections such as the flurepeated injuriessurgerya traumatic life event such as a breakup, divorce, or the death of a loved onechildbirthSleep disturbancesProblems getting enough sleep or spending enough time in the deepest stages of sleep are common in this disorder. But doctors aren’t sure if this is a symptom or a cause of fibromyalgia. Abnormal sleep patterns can affect the levels of some brain chemicals.Risk factors for fibromyalgiaSeveral factors increase the risk of fibromyalgia. But having one of these following risk factors doesn’t mean you’ll be diagnosed with the condition. GenderFibromyalgia is more common in women than in men. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), women are eight to nine times more likely than men to have fibromyalgia. Scientists believe women experience pain differently than men.This is partly because female reproductive hormones, such as estrogen, make women more sensitive to pain. It’s why pain levels fluctuate during a woman’s menstrual cycles when estrogen levels rise and fall.Menopause, which also results in lowered levels of estrogen, is another potential risk factor for fibromyalgia. Read more: Why does fibromyalgia predominantly affect women? »AgeAccording to the NFA, most people with fibromyalgia are diagnosed in early to middle adulthood, between the ages of 20 and 50. Family historyIf you have a close family member with fibromyalgia, you’re more likely to be diagnosed yourself.Sleep disordersIt’s not known if sleep problems are a symptom or a cause of fibromyalgia. Some people who have disorders affecting sleep, such as sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome (RLS), are more likely to have the condition.Other rheumatic diseasesRheumatic diseases affect the joints, muscles, and bones. People who have another rheumatic disease are more likely to have fibromyalgia. These diseases include:rheumatoid arthritis (RA)osteoarthritis (OA)lupusankylosing spondylitisDepressionMood disorders and fibromyalgia are closely related. Mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety stem from the same chemical imbalances linked to fibromyalgia. The strain of living with chronic pain can also cause depression. Also, depression can make your pain worse. Other possible risk factors for fibromyalgia include not exercising, exercising too much, and undergoing surgery.Outlook for fibromyalgiaYour outlook depends on the severity of your fibromyalgia. The condition usually continues long-term, but it’s milder in some people than in others. Fibromyalgia isn’t life-threatening, but it can be life-altering. Learning how to cope with your condition will give you the best possible outcome. Talk with your doctor about finding the best treatment and support options.",https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia-causes,Fibromyalgia,HealthLine: Fibromyalgia Causes
60,"HomeHealth InformationFibromyalgia: In DepthFibromyalgia: In DepthÂ©ThinkstockWhatâs the Bottom Line?What do we know about the effectiveness of complementary health approaches for fibromyalgia?Psychological and Physical ApproachesAlthough some studies of tai chi, yoga, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback for fibromyalgia have had promising results, the evidence is too limited to allow definite conclusions to be reached about whether these approaches are helpful.Itâs uncertain whether acupuncture is helpful for fibromyalgia pain.Some preliminary research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for fibromyalgia symptoms has had promising results.Nutritional ApproachesVitamin D supplements may reduce pain in people with fibromyalgia who are deficient in this vitamin.What do we know about the safety of complementary health approaches for fibromyalgia?The psychological and physical approaches discussed here generally have good safety records. However, some may need to be adapted to make them safe and comfortable for people with fibromyalgia.Some of the dietary supplements that have been studied for fibromyalgia may have side effects or interact with medications.Headaches sometimes occur as a side effect of TMS for fibromyalgia. TMS and other procedures involving magnets may not be safe for people who have metal implants or medical devices such as pacemakers in their bodies.What Is Fibromyalgia?Fibromyalgia is a common disorder that involves widespread pain, tenderness, fatigue, and other symptoms. Itâs not a form of arthritis, but like arthritis, it can interfere with a personâs ability to perform everyday activities. An estimated 5 million American adults have fibromyalgia. Between 80 and 90 percent of people with fibromyalgia are women, but men and children can also have this condition.More About FibromyalgiaIn addition to pain and fatigue, people with fibromyalgia may have other symptoms, such as cognitive and memory problems, sleep disturbances, morning stiffness, headaches, painful menstrual periods, numbness or tingling of the extremities, restless legs syndrome, temperature sensitivity, and sensitivity to loud noises or bright lights.A person may have two or more coexisting chronic pain conditions. Such conditions can include chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and vulvodynia. Itâs not known whether these disorders share a common cause.The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unclear, but it may be related to injury, emotional distress, or viruses that change the way the brain perceives pain. Thereâs no diagnostic test for fibromyalgia, so health care providers diagnose it by examining the patient, evaluating symptoms, and ruling out other conditions.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved several drugs to treat fibromyalgia, but medication is just one part of conventional medical treatment. Nondrug approaches such as exercise and good sleep habits can also help manage symptoms. Research has repeatedly shown that regular exercise is one of the most effective treatments for fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia who have too much pain or fatigue to do vigorous exercise should begin with walking or other gentle exercise and build their endurance and intensity slowly.For more information about fibromyalgia, visit the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases website.What the Science Says About Complementary Health Approaches for FibromyalgiaComplementary approaches can be classified by their primary therapeutic input (how the therapy is taken in or delivered), which may be:Nutritional (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs, probiotics, and microbial-based therapies).Psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music therapies, relaxation therapies).Physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage, spinal manipulation).Combinations such as psychological and physical (e.g., yoga, tai chi, dance therapies, some forms of art therapy) or psychological and nutritional (e.g., mindful eating).Nutritional approaches include what the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) previously categorized as natural products, whereas psychological and/or physical approaches include what was referred to as mind and body practices.A variety of complementary approaches have been studied for fibromyalgia. The following sections summarize the evidence on the effectiveness and safety of specific approaches.Â Psychological and Physical ApproachesAcupunctureAcupuncture is a technique in which practitioners stimulate specific points on the body, known as acupuncture points. This is most often done using needles that penetrate the skin (manual acupuncture), but other techniques, such as using electrical current (electroacupuncture), may also be used.Limited evidence indicates that people with fibromyalgia who receive acupuncture have improvements in symptoms such as pain and stiffness when compared to those who donât receive it (for example, people on a waiting list). However, acupuncture hasnât been shown to be more effective than simulated acupuncture in relieving fibromyalgia symptoms. Electroacupuncture may produce better results than manual acupuncture.Acupuncture is generally considered safe when performed by an experienced practitioner using sterile needles. Improperly performed acupuncture can cause potentially serious side effects.More information about acupunctureBiofeedbackBiofeedback techniques measure body functions and give you information about them so that you can learn to control them.A small number of short-term studies of biofeedback, particularly electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, in which people learn to control and decrease muscle tension, indicate that it may reduce fibromyalgia pain. However, the overall evidence on biofeedback is so limited that no definite conclusions can be reached about whether itâs helpful for fibromyalgia symptoms.In studies of EMG biofeedback for fibromyalgia, some participants reported that the procedure was stressful. No other side effects were reported.Guided ImageryGuided imagery is a technique in which people are taught to focus on pleasant images to replace negative or stressful feelings. Guided imagery may be self-directed or led by a practitioner or a recording.Studies of guided imagery for fibromyalgia symptoms have had inconsistent results. In some studies, patients who were taught guided imagery had decreases in symptoms such as pain and fatigue, but in other studies it had no effect.Guided imagery is one of a group of approaches called relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques are generally considered safe for healthy people. Occasionally, however, people report unpleasant experiences such as increased anxiety.More information about guided imagery and other relaxation techniquesMagnetic TherapiesStatic (permanent) magnets are found in magnetic mattress pads, shoe inserts, bracelets, and other products. Thereâs not enough evidence on static magnets to allow any conclusions to be reached.Electromagnets are used in a type of treatment called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which influences brain activity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved certain TMS devices for treating migraine and treatment-resistant depression. A small number of preliminary studies have evaluated TMS for fibromyalgia symptoms, and some have had promising results.Magnets and magnetic devices may not be safe for people who have metal implants or medical devices such as pacemakers in their bodies. Headaches have been reported as a side effect in several studies of TMS for fibromyalgia.More information about magnetsMassage TherapyMassage therapy includes a variety of techniques in which practitioners manipulate the soft tissues of the body.Several studies have evaluated various types of massage therapy for fibromyalgia. Most indicated that massage could provide short-term relief of some fibromyalgia symptoms. However, the current evidence is too limited to be considered conclusive. Experts recommend that massage therapy for fibromyalgia should not cause pain. It may be necessary to start with very gentle massage and increase the intensity gradually over time.Massage therapy appears to have few risks when performed by a trained practitioner.More information about massage therapyMindfulness MeditationMindfulness meditation is a type of meditation that involves completely focusing on experiences on a moment-to-moment basis.In several studies, mindfulness meditation training has led to short-term improvements in pain and quality of life in people with fibromyalgia. However, the number of studies is small, and the quality of the evidence is relatively low, so no definite conclusions can be reached. Frequent practice of mindfulness techniques may be important for good results. In a 2014 study of mindfulness for fibromyalgia, those participants who practiced mindfulness more frequently had a greater reduction in symptoms.Mindfulness and other forms of meditation are generally considered to be safe for healthy people. However, they may need to be modified to make them safe and comfortable for people with some health conditions.More information about meditationMeditative Movement Practices (Tai Chi, Qigong, and Yoga)Tai chi and qigong, which originated in China, and yoga, which is of Indian origin, all involve a combination of physical postures or movements, a focus on breathing, and meditation or relaxation. Because these three practices have so many features in common, they are sometimes grouped together as meditative movement practices.Exercise is beneficial for people with fibromyalgia, so meditative movement practices may be helpful because of the physical activity they involve. Itâs also possible that the meditative component of these practices might help too. Some individual studies of tai chi, qigong, or yoga for fibromyalgia symptoms have had promising results. However, there isnât enough high-quality evidence on these approaches to allow definite conclusions to be reached about their effects.Meditative movement practices generally have good safety records when practiced under the guidance of a qualified instructor. Few side effects have been reported in studies of yoga, tai chi, or qigong. However, these practices may need to be modified to make them suitable for people with fibromyalgia.More information about yoga and tai chi and qigongOther Psychological and Physical ApproachesSo little research has been done on chiropractic care and hypnosis for fibromyalgia that no conclusions can be reached about these practices.An approach called amygdala retraining, which includes various psychological and physical practices, has been proposed as a treatment for fibromyalgia. Because almost no research has been done on this approach, its effectiveness and safety cannot be evaluated.Nutritional ApproachesIt has been suggested that deficiencies in vitamin D might worsen fibromyalgia symptoms. In one study of women with fibromyalgia who had low vitamin D levels, 20 weeks of vitamin D supplementation led to a reduction in pain.Researchers are investigating whether low magnesium levels contribute to fibromyalgia and if magnesium supplements might help to reduce symptoms.Other substances of natural origin that have been studied for fibromyalgia include dietary supplements such as soy, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), and creatine. Thereâs not enough evidence to determine whether these products are helpful.âNaturalâ doesnât necessarily mean âsafe.â Products of natural origin can have side effects, and some may interact with medications. Even vitamins and minerals (including vitamin D and magnesium) can be harmful if taken in excessive amounts.Other Complementary ApproachesBalneotherapyBalneotherapy is the technique of bathing in tap or mineral water for health purposes; it also includes related practices such as mud packs. Although some research has been done on balneotherapy for fibromyalgia, thereâs not enough evidence to reach definite conclusions on whether it relieves symptoms.Balneotherapy has a good safety record.HomeopathyHomeopathy is a medical system based on the unconventional idea that a disease can be cured by highly diluted solutions of a substance that causes similar symptoms in healthy people. Studies of homeopathy have not demonstrated that it is beneficial for fibromyalgia.Highly diluted homeopathic remedies are generally safe. However, not all products labeled as homeopathic are highly dilute; some may contain substantial amounts of ingredients and therefore could cause side effects.More information about homeopathyReikiReiki is a complementary health approach in which practitioners place their hands lightly on or just above a person, with the goal of facilitating the personâs own healing response. An NCCIH-funded study examined the use of Reiki for fibromyalgia-related pain. The study showed no effect of Reiki on pain or any of the other outcomes measured in the study (physical and mental functioning, medication use, and visits to health care providers).Reiki appears to be generally safe.More information about ReikiTopical Herbal ProductsTopical products containing capsaicin (the substance that gives chili peppers their heat) have been studied for fibromyalgia. There's not enough evidence to determine whether these products are helpful.NCCIH-Funded ResearchRecent NCCIH-sponsored studies have been investigating various aspects of complementary and integrative interventions for fibromyalgia, including:The effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine for treating fibromyalgiaHow tai chi compares to aerobic exercise as an adjunctive treatment for fibromyalgia symptomsWhether brain responses to placebos differ between people with fibromyalgia and healthy people.More To ConsiderBe aware that some complementary health approachesâparticularly dietary supplementsâmay interact with conventional medical treatments. To learn more about using dietary supplements, see the NCCIH fact sheet Using Dietary Supplements Wisely and the NCCIH interactive module Understanding Drug-Supplement Interactions.If youâre considering a practitioner-provided complementary health approach such as acupuncture, check with your insurer to see if the services will be covered, and ask a trusted source (like your fibromyalgia health care provider or a nearby hospital or medical school) to recommend a practitioner.Tell all your health care providers about any complementary or integrative health approaches you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated and safe care.For More InformationNCCIH ClearinghouseThe NCCIH Clearinghouse provides information onÂ NCCIHÂ and complementary and integrative health approaches, including publications and searches of Federal databases of scientific and medical literature.

61," OverviewFibromyalgia is an often-misunderstood form of rheumatoid disease. It’s usually classified alongside other forms of rheumatic disorders, such as arthritis and lupus. However, the exact cause of fibromyalgia remains unknown. To add to the confusion, fibromyalgia predominantly affects women. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it’s twice as common in women as it is in men. While anyone can get fibromyalgia, hormones are thought to be a possible explanation for this gender bias. Learn more about how this painful syndrome affects women, and what can be done about it. PrevalenceThe CDC estimates that about 4 million adults in the United States have fibromyalgia. It can technically develop in anyone at any age, but fibromyalgia typically develops in middle-aged adults.  Risk factorsSince the disorder primarily occurs in women, being female is a risk factor.Other risk factors that increase your chances of developing fibromyalgia include:a personal or family history of fibromyalgia or other rheumatoid diseaserecurring injuries in the same part of the bodyanxiety or long-term stressneurological disordersgoing through a major physical event, such as a car accidenta history of serious infectionsHaving a history of any of the above factors doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll develop fibromyalgia. You should still be aware of these risks and discuss them with your doctor if you’re concerned. Find out more about fibromyalgia causes and risk factors. Most common symptoms of fibromyalgiaThe most common symptoms of fibromyalgia tend to affect both men and women equally. But not all people with the disorder experience pain in the same spots. These points of pressure can even change day to day. Fibromyalgia often feels like extreme muscle pain, usually accompanied by fatigue. Some of the most common symptoms include:headaches, either tension-type or migrainesback achespain and numbness in the limbsstiffness in the morning sensitivity to light, temperature changes, and noisesfacial or jaw pain and tendernessforgetfulness, which is sometimes called “fibro fog”sleeping difficulties Other symptoms seen in womenThere’s no conclusive link between specific hormones and fibromyalgia, but researchers have noted some possible strong connections. A 2015 study found that women with fibromyalgia are also more likely to have frequent symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and primary dysmenorrhea, or painful menstrual periods. Women in the study group were found to experience extreme lower abdominal and lower back pain for two days before menstruation. Other researchers point to another explanation for the prevalence of fibromyalgia in women. A 2010 Danish study suggested that men might be underdiagnosed with fibromyalgia because of a lack of noticeable “tender points.” So while men might not have PMS symptoms, for example, they might have other forms of mild pressure points that are often ignored. Learn more about fibromyalgia tender points. DiagnosisFibromyalgia can be difficult to diagnose because the signs aren’t visible on an X-ray, blood test, or other exam. Women who experience painful menstrual cycles might also pass it off as a normal hormonal issue.According to the Mayo Clinic, most people experience widespread pain for three months or longer before being diagnosed with fibromyalgia. A rheumatologist will also rule out any other possible causes of pain before diagnosing you.  Treatments and other considerationsIf you’re diagnosed with fibromyalgia, your treatment options may include:prescription pain relieversantidepressants to control hormonesprescription muscle relaxersoral contraceptives to ease primary dysmenorrhea and PMSphysical therapyexerciseacupuncture or chiropractic treatmentspsychotherapysleep therapyneuromodulator medicationsIt’s important to note that there’s no cure for fibromyalgia. The goal of treatment is to alleviate pain and improve your quality of life. Discover seven natural remedies that may also help with fibromyalgia pain. OutlookFibromyalgia is considered a chronic condition that can last a lifetime. This is true in both men and women. The good news is that it isn’t considered a progressive disease — it doesn’t cause any direct damage to the body. This is different from rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which can damage joints. Also, fibromyalgia isn’t fatal. However, this doesn’t necessarily ease the pain that millions of women with fibromyalgia experience. The key is to keep up with your treatment plan, and to see your rheumatologist if it’s not working. The more researchers learn about the disorder and its effects on adults with the condition, the more hope there is for preventive treatments in the future.

62,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic health condition that involves widespread pain throughout your body, tenderness in certain areas, and fatigue. It can be difficult for your doctor to diagnose fibromyalgia. There are no lab tests or imaging tests available for it. Instead, your doctor will ask you to describe and rate your symptoms.A number of other conditions can have similar symptoms as fibromyalgia, including:HIVAIDSLyme diseasecertain types of cancerdegenerative diseases of the spinehypothyroidismYour doctor can use clinical tests to rule out many of these conditions. But doing so takes a lot of time, effort, and money. According to the National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association, it takes an estimated 5 years on average for a patient with fibromyalgia to get a proper diagnosis.What are the diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia?In 2010, the American College of Rheumatology endorsed a new set of criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia. They published those criteria in the journal Arthritis Care and Research. According to those criteria, you have fibromyalgia if you meet the following three conditions:You have a widespread pain index (WPI) score of seven or higher and a symptom severity scale (SS) score of five or higher. Or you have a WPI score of three to six and a SS score of nine or higher.You’ve experienced symptoms at a similar level for at least 3 months.You don’t have another disorder that could explain your symptoms.Before these criteria were adopted, doctors used a “tender point” system to diagnose fibromyalgia. Under the old system, you needed to have widespread pain, as well tenderness when pressure was applied to at least 11 out of 18 points on your body. Over time, experts realized that many doctors didn’t know how to check for tender points or refused to do so. Plus, the older system didn’t account for many symptoms that have since been recognized as key features of fibromyalgia, like fatigue or depression.Researchers believe the new system is better for diagnosing fibromyalgia.What do the widespread pain index and symptom severity scale measure?Your doctor will likely use the WPI and SS to check you for signs of fibromyalgia.They’ll use the WPI to check for a history of pain in 19 areas of your body. For each area where you’ve felt pain in the past 7 days, you’ll receive one point. Your doctor will add up all of your points for a final score between 0 and 19. They’ll use the SS to check for symptoms in four categories unrelated to pain. This includes fatigue, cognitive problems, and other possible signs of fibromyalgia. Your doctor will also ask you to rate the severity of these symptoms over the past week, on a scale from 0 to 3. Then they’ll add up all of your points for a final score between 0 and 12. You might have the disorder if you receive a:WPI score greater than 7 and SS score greater than 5WPI score between 3 and 6 and SS score greater than 9To be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, you need to have experienced symptoms at a similar level for at least 3 months. Your doctor should also take steps to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.What are tender points?The official diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia no longer requires a tender point examination. But your doctor might still check for 18 tender points associated with the disorder. Tender points feel painful when only a small amount of pressure is applied. To conduct a tender point exam, your doctor will press on 18 points on your body with their fingertip. They’ll use just enough pressure to whiten their nail bed. Then they’ll ask if you feel any pain. The locations of these points include:between your shoulder bladesthe tops of your shouldersthe back of your headthe front of your neckyour upper chestyour outer elbowsyour upper hipsyour inner kneesthe sides of your hipsHow will your doctor rule out other diseases?Many conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of fibromyalgia. Your doctor must rule out those conditions to make an accurate diagnosis. To do this, they may use:blood tests to check for signs of HIV or AIDS, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, or Lyme diseaseX-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans to check for signs of degenerative spinal diseases or certain kinds of cancertissue samples to check for cancerThey may also order other tests, like sleep studies or psychological exams.The takeawayIf you suspect you may have fibromyalgia, it’s a good idea to keep a pain diary. Use it to track your daily experiences of pain, including its:locationqualityseveritydurationThis will help your doctor get a full and accurate picture of your pain. They’ll probably use the widespread pain index and symptom severity scale to learn more about your symptoms. They may also check you for tender points. Finally, it’s important for your doctor to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.",https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia-diagnosis,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia Diagnosis
63,"Fibromyalgia isn’t an easy condition to diagnose. In the past, one way that doctors tried to narrow down a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was by exerting pressure on 18 small spots located throughout the body to elicit the sensations of tenderness and pain. These spots are known as tender points.In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology identified 18 specific spots that are often, but not always, tender in people with fibromyalgia. These spots became part of a diagnostic test.Prior to 2010, at least 11 of these 18 points had to test positive for tenderness for your doctor to officially diagnose you with fibromyalgia.The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia has since changed, and tender points are no longer used as a diagnostic tool. Fibromyalgia is now diagnosed through a series of laboratory tests that rule out other causes of widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. These new techniques have identified many more people with fibromyalgia that didn’t meet the tender points criteria. Read on to learn how providers used the tender points diagnostic method.Diagnosing fibromyalgia with tender pointsWhile the presence of tender points aren’t used to diagnose fibromyalgia, for historical purposes, we’ll describe these areas. They were previously defined as 18 tender points throughout the body, each about the size of a penny.Fibromyalgia tender points are located in clusters on both sides of the body, both above and below the waist. These clusters are located around the following areas: neckchestshoulderselbowshipskneesFor a point to be considered tender, the spot should produce localized pain when your doctor presses on it with their finger. The doctor would push with enough pressure that their fingernail turns white.A point that tested positive for tenderness would be painful only on the exact spot the doctor presses.One of the defining characteristics of fibromyalgia is that the pain usually fluctuates. It may come and go, move around, or vary widely in intensity from day to day. On the day that you call your doctor to make an appointment, you might have tenderness in all 18 tender points.On the day of the appointment itself, you may only have tenderness in four of them. Over the years, many people with fibromyalgia have gone undiagnosed because they didn’t have tenderness in 11 spots at the time of their physical exam.A tender point test is still a helpful guidepost for physicians. But expanding the diagnostic criteria has helped more people get the right diagnosis.Once you’re diagnosed with fibromyalgia, your doctor will be able to explain to you the current presumed etiology of the pain. You can then work with your doctor to improve your symptoms.Tips for coping with tender pointsPeople with fibromyalgia are typically more concerned about full-body aches and general tenderness than specific tender spots. If you have fibromyalgia, you probably think most about the symptoms that interfere with your daily life. These may include:morning stiffnessdifficulty movingpain during handshakes and hugspainful knots in your musclesPainful knots in your muscles are often myofascial trigger points. Trigger points are hard, knotty lumps that form in taut skeletal muscles. Unlike tender points, which produce only localized pain, trigger points produce both localized and referred pain.Referred pain feels like it shoots or radiates to a different part of your body. Trigger points are far more common in people with fibromyalgia than they are among the general population. However, anyone can develop them.There’s a chronic widespread pain condition called myofascial pain syndrome. It involves chronic trigger point pain. Myofascial pain syndrome can coexist with fibromyalgia.A study in The Journal of Pain found that most tender points are also myofascial trigger points.Additionally, a study published in the journal Pain discovered that much of the neck and shoulder pain that people with fibromyalgia experience is caused by trigger points, not tender points.This is good news, because there are several treatments for trigger point pain that you can start right away.Trigger point injections for fibromyalgiaTrigger point injections can deactivate a painful trigger point, providing pain relief in certain areas. Trigger point injections should be given by a trained pain specialist with specialized equipment. Injections can contain saline, steroids, or a local anesthetic like lidocaine.Ask your doctor if they administer trigger point injections or know of another doctor who does. Or visit the American Board of Pain Medicine’s directory of certified pain specialists to find someone in your area who administers trigger point injections.Acupuncture treatment for fibromyalgiaThere are many similarities between fibromyalgia tender points, myofascial trigger points, and acupuncture points. Acupuncture, the ancient Chinese practice of inserting needles into specific points on the body, has been used to relieve pain for thousands of years.If you haven’t tried acupuncture yet, it may be an excellent treatment option. Most acupuncture clinics can quickly fit you in for an appointment. You can check out the Acufinder directory of acupuncturists to find a traditional practitioner in your area. If you’re interested in seeing a doctor who practices acupuncture, you can check out the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture’s online directory.Trigger point massage therapy for fibromyalgiaA study in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics suggested that two types of massage therapy significantly help women with fibromyalgia.Manual lymph drainage therapy is a massage technique that moves fluid away from areas where lymph vessels are blocked or damaged.Connective tissue massage is an intense massage technique that focuses on manipulating myofascial tissue. Researchers suggest that both techniques lessen pain, improve quality of life, and increase pain thresholds.Not all massages are created equal, so don’t expect the best results from your local spa. You might want to start by asking for recommendations from friends, your family physician, or your fibromyalgia specialist.For more help finding a qualified massage therapist near you, also check out the American Massage Therapy Association’s directory of certified practitioners.TakeawayFibromyalgia tender points are areas where you may experience localized pain when they’re pressed.Trigger points cause localized and radiating pain. In order to experience relief from pain associated with both, talk to your doctor about potential therapies that may help.",https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia/fibromyalgia-tender-points,Fibromyalgia,What Are Fibromyalgia Tender Points?
64,"Fibromyalgia is a condition that causes chronic pain throughout the body. Many experts believe fibromyalgia causes the brain to sense higher pain levels, but the exact cause is unknown. It may also cause:fatigueanxietynerve pain and dysfunctionThere’s currently no cure, but treatment options focus primarily on pain management to reduce symptoms.Some believe fibromyalgia could be classified as an autoimmune disease because many of the symptoms overlap with those of autoimmune disorders. But without sufficient evidence showing that fibromyalgia produces autoantibodies or causes harm to surrounding tissues, it’s difficult to prove this claim.Discovering the cause of fibromyalgia might allow doctors to find improved preventive measures and better treatment options focused on alleviating pain symptoms. Read on to learn more.What’s an autoimmune disease?In autoimmune disorders, the body begins to attack itself as the immune system mistakenly identifies healthy cells as dangerous or harmful bacteria or viruses. In response, your body makes autoantibodies that destroy healthy cells. The attack causes damage to tissues and often inflammation at the affected site.Fibromyalgia doesn’t qualify as an autoimmune disorder because it doesn’t cause inflammation. There also isn’t any sufficient evidence indicating fibromyalgia causes damage to bodily tissues.Fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar or associated with other conditions, including some autoimmune disorders. In many cases, fibromyalgia can occur simultaneously with autoimmune disorders.Common conditions associated with fibromyalgia pain include:rheumatoid arthritislupushypothyroidismrestless leg syndromeLyme diseasetemporomandibular joint (TMJ) disordersmyofascial pain syndromedepressionResearchSome autoimmune disorders and fibromyalgia have similar symptoms and characteristics. It’s not uncommon to have fibromyalgia pain and an autoimmune disease at the same time. This can make it confusing when considering if fibromyalgia is an autoimmune disease.A 2007 study suggested that there are high levels of thyroid antibodies in patients with fibromyalgia. However, the presence of thyroid antibodies isn’t uncommon and may sometimes exhibit no symptoms.A 2013 study linked pain caused by fibromyalgia to small nerve fiber neuropathy. However, this association isn’t yet widely accepted.One animal study published in 2021 may indicate a possible autoimmune origin, but the evidence from just this study isn’t enough to prove this connection.There is, however, strong data linking small nerve fiber neuropathy and Sjögren’s disease. This condition causes painful damage to your nerves. But more research is needed to accurately link both fibromyalgia and small nerve fiber neuropathy.Though research suggests some relationship with autoimmunity, there’s not enough evidence to classify fibromyalgia as an autoimmune disorder.OutlookThough it has similar characteristics and symptoms, fibromyalgia isn’t currently classified as an autoimmune disorder. This doesn’t mean that it isn’t a real condition.If you have questions about fibromyalgia or want to stay up to date on the latest research, contact your doctor. Following the latest updates can help you find more ways to cope with your symptoms.",https://www.healthline.com/health/is-fibromyalgia-an-autoimmune-disease,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia: Is It an Autoimmune Disease?
65,"What is fibromyalgia?Fibromyalgia is a long-term, or chronic, condition. It causes symptoms such as:musculoskeletal pain, or pain in the muscles and bonestendernessgeneral fatiguesleep and cognitive disturbancesThis condition can be hard to understand, even for healthcare professionals. Its symptoms mimic those of other conditions, and there are no tests to definitively confirm a diagnosis. As a result, fibromyalgia is often misdiagnosed.In the past, some healthcare professionals even questioned whether fibromyalgia was real. Today, it’s much better understood.Around 4 million adults in the United States, or around 2 percent, have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Most fibromyalgia cases are diagnosed in females. Most people get diagnosed in middle age, but fibromyalgia can also affect children.Some of the stigmas that previously surrounded fibromyalgia have eased, but it can still be challenging to treat. Medications, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.You may also experience remission-type periods in which your pain and fatigue improve.Sex and gender exist on a spectrum. This article uses the terms “male” and “female” to refer to sex assigned at birth. Learn more about sex and gender.Fibromyalgia symptomsFibromyalgia causes what’s now referred to as regions of pain.Some of these regions overlap with the areas of tenderness traditionally known as tender points or trigger points. However, some of these previously noted areas of tenderness are not included in the regions of pain.The pain feels like a consistent, dull ache. A healthcare professional will consider a diagnosis of fibromyalgia if you’ve experienced musculoskeletal pain in four out of the five regions of pain outlined in the 2016 revision to the fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria.Current diagnostic criteria refer to fibromyalgia pain as multisite pain. In contrast, the 1990 fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria defined fibromyalgia pain as chronic widespread pain.In addition, the diagnostic process now focuses on the severity of pain and the areas of musculoskeletal pain. In the past, the duration of pain was the focal point of a fibromyalgia diagnosis.Other symptoms of fibromyalgia include:fatiguetrouble sleepingnonrestorative sleep, or sleeping for long periods of time without feeling restedheadachestrouble focusing or paying attentiondry eyesrashitchingpain or a dull ache in the lower abdomenbladder problems, such as interstitial cystitisdepressionanxietyThe condition can affect your emotions as well as your physical health. Discover more signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia.Fibro fogFibro fog or brain fog is a term some people use to describe the fuzzy feeling they get. Signs of fibro fog include:memory lapsesdifficulty concentratingtrouble staying alertAccording to a 2015 literature review, some people find mental fogginess from fibromyalgia more upsetting than the physical pain. Get tips for managing fibro fog.Fibromyalgia treatmentThere’s no cure for fibromyalgia at the moment.Instead, treatment focuses on reducing symptoms and improving quality of life with medications, self-care strategies, and lifestyle changes.In addition, you may wish to seek out support and guidance. This may involve joining a support group or seeing a therapist.Fibromyalgia medicationMedications can relieve pain and help you sleep better. Common medications for fibromyalgia include pain relievers, antiseizure drugs, and antidepressants.Pain relieversFibromyalgia pain can be uncomfortable enough and consistent enough to interfere with your daily routine. Do not just settle for pain. Talk with a healthcare professional about ways to manage it.If your pain is mild, one option is to take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as:acetaminophen (Tylenol)aspirinibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)These medications can lower your pain levels, reduce discomfort, and help you better manage your condition. They may even help you sleep better.Many of them bring down inflammation, too. Though inflammation is not a primary symptom of fibromyalgia, you may experience it if you have a related condition such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Please note that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do have side effects. Caution is advised if NSAIDs are used for an extended period, as is usually the case when you’re managing a chronic pain condition.Opioids have also been prescribed for pain relief. However, research has not shown them to be effective over time. Also, the dosage for narcotics is typically increased rapidly, which can pose a health risk for people prescribed these drugs.Tramadol (Ultram) is one of the opioids most closely associated with fibromyalgia relief. However, some experts do not consider it a traditional opioid, and any possible benefits for fibromyalgia could be due to it also being a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).According to a 2020 study, there’s not enough evidence to support or oppose the use of tramadol in fibromyalgia. More research on opioids is needed.Antiseizure drugsPregabalin (Lyrica), an antiseizure drug, was the first medication the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for fibromyalgia. It blocks nerve cells from sending out pain signals.Gabapentin (Neurontin) was designed to treat epilepsy, but it may also help reduce symptoms in people with fibromyalgia. Gabapentin has not been FDA-approved to treat fibromyalgia and is considered an off-label drug.Off-label drug useOff-label drug use means a drug that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for one purpose is used for a different purpose that has not yet been approved.However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care.AntidepressantsAntidepressants such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) are sometimes used to treat pain and fatigue from fibromyalgia. These medications may also work on rebalancing neurotransmitters and help improve sleep.The FDA has approved both duloxetine and milnacipran for the treatment of fibromyalgia.Other medicationsOther drugs that are not FDA-approved to treat fibromyalgia, such as sleep aids, can help with specific symptoms. Muscle relaxers, which were once used, are no longer recommended.Researchers are also investigating a few experimental treatments that may help people with fibromyalgia in the future.Natural remedies for fibromyalgiaIf medications do not relieve your symptoms entirely, you can look for alternatives.Many natural remedies focus on lowering stress and reducing pain, and they can help you feel better both mentally and physically. You can use them alone or together with traditional medical treatments.Natural remedies for fibromyalgia include:occupational and physical therapy, which improves your strength and reduces stress on your bodyacupuncturemassage therapymeditationyoga, which you should approach with caution if you have hypermobilitytai chiexercisestress-reduction techniquesa balanced, nutrient-rich diet5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), an amino acidTherapy can potentially reduce the stress that triggers fibromyalgia symptoms. Group therapy may be the most affordable option, and it can give you a chance to meet others who are going through the same issues.Individual therapy is also available if you prefer one-on-one help. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one approach for managing stressful situations.It’s important to note that most alternative treatments for fibromyalgia have not been thoroughly studied or proven effective. Ask a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks before trying some of these treatments.Fibromyalgia causesHealthcare professionals and researchers do not know what causes fibromyalgia.According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress).Experts do not fully understand what causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either.One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time.Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to a chemical imbalance in the brain or an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster of neurons in the spine.GenesFibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it.Researchers think certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells.Infections A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include:flupneumoniaEpstein-Barr virusgastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteria Salmonella and ShigellaTraumaPeople who go through severe physical or emotional trauma may develop fibromyalgia. The condition has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).StressLike trauma, stress can have long-lasting effects on your body. Stress has been linked to hormonal changes that could contribute to fibromyalgia.Fibromyalgia tender pointsIn the past, a person was diagnosed with fibromyalgia if they had widespread pain and tenderness in at least 11 out of 18 specific points around their body. Healthcare professionals would check to see how many of these points were painful by pressing firmly on them.Common tender points, or trigger points, included the:back of the headtops of the shouldersupper chestouter elbowshipskneesFor the most part, tender points are no longer a part of the diagnostic process.Instead, healthcare professionals may diagnose fibromyalgia if you’ve had pain in four out of the five areas of pain as defined by the 2016 revised diagnostic criteria, and you have no other diagnosable medical condition that could explain the pain. Learn more about fibromyalgia tender points.Fibromyalgia painPain is the hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia. You’ll feel it in various muscles and other soft tissues around your body.The pain can range from a mild achiness to an intense and almost unbearable discomfort. Its severity could dictate how well you cope day to day.Chest painWhen fibromyalgia pain is in your chest, it can feel similar to the pain of a heart attack.Chest pain in fibromyalgia is centered in the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone. The pain may radiate to your shoulders and arms.Fibromyalgia chest pain may feel:sharpstabbinglike a burning sensationas if you’re struggling to catch your breath, which is also a symptom of a heart attack Back painYour back is one of the most common places you’ll feel pain. Most people have low back pain at some point in their lives. If your back hurts, it may not be clear whether fibromyalgia is to blame or if it’s another condition such as arthritis or a pulled muscle.Other symptoms such as brain fog and fatigue can point to fibromyalgia as the cause. It’s also possible to have a combination of fibromyalgia and arthritis.The same medications you take to relieve your other fibromyalgia symptoms can help with back pain, too. Stretching and strengthening exercises can help support the muscles and other soft tissues of your back.Leg painYou may feel fibromyalgia pain in the muscles and soft tissues of your legs.Leg pain caused by fibromyalgia can feel similar to the stiffness of arthritis or the soreness of a pulled muscle. The pain can be described as deep, burning, or throbbing.Sometimes fibromyalgia in the legs feels like numbness or tingling. You may have a creepy-crawly sensation. An uncontrollable urge to move your legs is a sign of restless legs syndrome, which can overlap with fibromyalgia.Fatigue sometimes manifests in the legs too. Your limbs can feel heavy, as if they’re held down by weights.Fibromyalgia risk factorsAvailable research still has not identified an exact cause of fibromyalgia. Factors that may increase your risk of developing it include:Sex. Most fibromyalgia cases are currently diagnosed in females, but the reason for this disparity is not clear.Age. You’re most likely to be diagnosed in middle age, and your risk increases as you get older. Children can develop fibromyalgia too.Family history. If you have close family members with fibromyalgia, you may be at greater risk for developing it.A history of other conditions. Although fibromyalgia is not a form of arthritis, having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may increase your risk of also having fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia also affects around 30 percent of people with lupus.Research continues to evolve to better understand this condition and its origin.Fibromyalgia and autoimmunityIn autoimmune diseases such as RA and lupus, the body mistakenly targets its own tissues.The immune system uses proteins called autoantibodies to attack the joints or other healthy tissues in the same way it would normally attack viruses or bacteria. Having a small number of autoantibodies is normal, but high levels may indicate an autoimmune disease.Autoimmune diseases and fibromyalgia have some overlapping symptoms, such as fatigue and trouble concentrating. It can be hard for healthcare professionals to determine whether you have an autoimmune disease or fibromyalgia. You can even have both types of conditions simultaneously.The overlap in symptoms has led to the theory that fibromyalgia could also be an autoimmune disease.This claim has been hard to prove, partly because there’s been little to no evidence that autoantibodies are involved in fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia does not traditionally cause inflammation, either. Inflammation is a common symptom of autoimmune diseases.However, a small 2021 study found that autoantibodies may contribute to fibromyalgia after all.In the study, researchers injected mice with autoantibodies from people with fibromyalgia or people without fibromyalgia. The mice injected with autoantibodies from people with fibromyalgia began to experience fibromyalgia-like symptoms, such as reduced muscular strength and greater sensitivity to painful sensations (like cold). The mice injected with autoantibodies from healthy people did not have any symptoms.A different 2021 study from Taiwan has pointed to a link between fibromyalgia and the inflammatory autoimmune disease Sjögren’s disease. People with fibromyalgia were twice as likely to develop Sjögren’s as people without fibromyalgia, according to data collected between 2000 and 2012.More research is needed, but these study results are encouraging.If fibromyalgia is an autoimmune disease, treatments for autoimmune diseases could potentially help treat fibromyalgia, too. Learn more about the relationship between fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases.Fibromyalgia in femalesAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fibromyalgia is twice as common in women as it is in men. Research has traditionally concluded that at least 80 to 90 percent of fibromyalgia cases are diagnosed in women, according to a 2018 study on bias in fibromyalgia diagnosis. Fibromyalgia may be underdiagnosed in men, though.Fibromyalgia symptoms have generally been more severe in people who are female than in people who are male. People assigned female at birth have more widespread pain, symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and morning fatigue than people assigned male at birth. Painful periods are also common.In addition, the transition to menopause could make fibromyalgia worse. Complicating matters is the fact that some symptoms of menopause and fibromyalgia look almost identical. Learn more about how fibromyalgia affects people assigned female at birth.Fibromyalgia in malesMales can have fibromyalgia, but they may remain undiagnosed because it’s viewed as a predominantly female disease.When the 2016 diagnostic criteria are applied, more men are diagnosed, according to the 2018 study on bias. The conventional wisdom is that at least 80 to 90 percent of fibromyalgia cases affect women. When data from a German study were reanalyzed, researchers found that women comprised only 59.2 percent of the fibromyalgia cases. This means men comprised 40.8 percent of the cases.Males with fibromyalgia may have severe pain and emotional symptoms. The condition may affect their quality of life, career, and relationships, according to a 2018 survey.Part of the stigma and difficulty in getting diagnosed stems from society’s expectation that males who are in pain should “suck it up.” Those who do see a doctor can face emotional discomfort and the chance that their complaints will not be taken seriously.Fibromyalgia diagnosisA healthcare professional may diagnose you with fibromyalgia if you’ve had widespread pain for 3 months or longer in four out of five specific regions. “Widespread” means the pain is on both sides of your body, and you feel it above and below your waist.After a thorough examination, they must conclude that no other condition is causing your pain.Healthcare professionals typically use a process of elimination to diagnose fibromyalgia.There are no imaging scans that can detect it. However, a healthcare professional may use imaging scans or various blood tests to help rule out other possible causes of your chronic pain.The FM/a test is a blood test that may be used to diagnose fibromyalgia. The manufacturers of the test claim that it’s definitive, but other experts are more skeptical of its usefulness. It detects the presence of chemokine and cytokine proteins. Find out more about how fibromyalgia is diagnosed.Fibromyalgia dietSome people with fibromyalgia report that they feel better when they follow a specific diet plan or avoid certain foods. Research has not proven that any one diet improves fibromyalgia symptoms.If you’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, try to eat a balanced diet overall. Nutritious foods provide you with a constant energy supply and help you keep your body healthy. They may also help prevent symptoms from getting worse.Some dietary strategies to keep in mind:Eat fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein.Eat more plants than meat.Drink plenty of water.Reduce the amount of sugar in your diet.Try to incorporate regular exercise, too, and work toward achieving and maintaining a moderate weight.You may find that certain foods or substances, like gluten or monosodium glutamate (MSG), make your symptoms worse. If that’s the case, keep a food diary to track what you eat and how you feel after each meal. Share this diary with your doctor.

66,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly challenging for people living with fibromyalgia, a condition characterized by widespread pain and tenderness throughout the body. People with fibromyalgia often live with other chronic conditions that can increase their risk of becoming severely ill from COVID-19. And even a mild case of COVID-19 may cause fibromyalgia symptoms to flare up. Fortunately, COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for people with fibromyalgia. If you have fibromyalgia, getting vaccinated, and staying up to date with booster shots, is the best way to protect yourself. What are the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine for people with fibromyalgia?People with fibromyalgia face unique challenges when they become ill. Research published in 2021 has found that, overall, fibromyalgia symptoms might get worse in people diagnosed with COVID-19.As such, the COVID-19 vaccine may have the added benefit of helping prevent a worsening of the fibromyalgia symptoms that you may already cope with daily.Fibromyalgia symptoms include:widespread pain and tendernessfatiguetrouble with thinking, concentration, and memory, often called “fibro fog”difficulty sleepingdepression or anxietyheadachenumbness and tingling, particularly in the arms or legsdigestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)Also, physical stress due to an infection can trigger a symptom flare-up. Fibromyalgia flare-ups are periods where fibromyalgia symptoms become worse than usual.Emotional stress can also lead to a flare-up. Getting vaccinated can help provide peace of mind, which benefits your physical and mental health. When you’re fully vaccinated, you can get outside and socialize with more confidence, an important part of maintaining your mental wellness. Fibromyalgia and COVID-19 vaccine side effectsSome people who get the COVID-19 vaccine won’t have any side effects. When they do happen, some of the most common vaccine side effects include:pain, redness, or swelling at the injection sitefatiguefever, with or without chillsmuscle painheadachenauseaThese side effects are a sign that your body’s immune is responding to the vaccine. They should go away within a few days.Some of the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine overlap with fibromyalgia symptoms. You may feel like your fibromyalgia symptoms worsen slightly in the days after getting your vaccine.There are currently no reports in the scientific or medical literature of fibromyalgia flare-ups following the COVID-19 vaccine.Testimonials from individuals with fibromyalgia also contain no mention of flare-ups after getting the COVID-19 vaccine.Also, a 2015 study found that fibromyalgia symptoms didn’t change after participants received the flu vaccine, which has similar side effects to the COVID-19 vaccine.COVID-19 vaccine guidelines for people with fibromyalgiaThere are no specific COVID-19 vaccination recommendations for people with fibromyalgia. If you have fibromyalgia, you should follow the general recommendations for people in your age group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone age 5 and older receive a COVID-19 vaccine.The table below shows the current COVID-19 vaccine recommendations at the time of publication.Primary seriesFirst boosterSecond boosterPfizer-BioNTechAges 5 to 11: 2 doses spaced 3 weeks apart Age 12 and up: 2 doses spaced 3 to 8 weeks apartAges 5 to 11: Pfizer-BioNTech booster at least 5 months after primary series Ages 12 to 17: Pfizer-BioNTech booster at least 5 months after primary series Age 18 and up: Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 5 months after primary seriesAge 12 and up (immunocompromised only): Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 4 months after first boosterAge 50 and up: Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 4 months after first boosterModernaAge 18 and up: 2 doses spaced 4 to 8 weeks apartAge 18 and up: Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 5 months after primary seriesAge 18 and up (immunocompromised only): Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 4 months after first boosterAge 50 and up: Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 4 months after first boosterJohnson & JohnsonAge 18 and up: One doseAge 18 and up: Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 2 months after primary doseAge 50 and up: Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster at least 4 months after first boosterAccording to the CDC, the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, both mRNA vaccines, are preferable to the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccine. This is because mRNA vaccines are more effective and have a better overall safety profile than the J&J vaccine.Clinical trials found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 95 percent and 94.1 percent, respectively, effective at preventing COVID-19. However, these numbers have dropped with the emergence of new virus variants.While their effectiveness at preventing infections has dropped, mRNA vaccines still prevent severe illness and hospitalization. Studies have found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines remain very effective at preventing hospitalization due to the Omicron variant.Are people with fibromyalgia at increased risk of COVID-19?Research from 2021 has found that fibromyalgia itself doesn’t put you at an increased risk of severe COVID-19. However, many people with fibromyalgia have other health conditions (comorbidities) that do raise the risk for severe COVID-19.Examples of such conditions include: autoimmune diseasesdiabetesheart diseaseobesity  Receiving a COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces the likelihood of becoming severely ill with COVID-19.It’s estimated that fibromyalgia impacts about 5 percent of the world’s population. Its cause is still unknown, although a combination of genetics and environmental triggers is believed to play a role.How to tell if you have COVID-19?Some of the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those you may experience with fibromyalgia, including:muscle painfatigueheadacheHowever, several other symptoms can indicate you may have contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These include:fever, with or without chillscoughsore throatrunny or stuffy noseloss of smell or tasteshortness of breathdigestive symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or diarrheaIf you develop worrisome symptoms and think you may have COVID-19, it’s important to get tested. Both PCR and antigen tests can detect current infections.Use the Department of Health and Human Services search tool to find community-based testing centers. You can also obtain at-home COVID-19 tests at your local pharmacy or order free home tests from the government. Some insurance providers, including Medicare, may cover the costs of home tests or offer reimbursements. Check with your provider for specifics. TakeawayThe COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for people with fibromyalgia. There are currently no reports of significant side effects in individuals with fibromyalgia who’ve been vaccinated. Developing COVID-19 may cause the symptoms of fibromyalgia to worsen. Getting vaccinated will help protect you from severe illness and prevent a mild case of COVID-19 from potentially triggering a fibromyalgia symptom flare. There aren’t any specific COVID-19 vaccine guidelines for people with fibromyalgia. Overall, the CDC recommends that everyone age 5 and older receive a full vaccination series and boosters.If you have any vaccine-related questions or concerns, be sure to discuss them with a doctor.

67,"Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease that affects around 4 million adults in the United States (1).Though research is limited, scientific evidence shows that some diets reduce pain and symptoms related to fibromyalgia.This article reviews which foods to eat and avoid to help manage fibromyalgia, along with 10 tasty recipes.Share on PinterestFibromyalgia and dietFibromyalgia is a chronic condition that’s characterized by widespread muscle pain. Due to chronic pain, many people with fibromyalgia also have sleep disorders, chronic fatigue, and depression (1). The cause of fibromyalgia isn’t yet known, and the condition cannot be cured. People with fibromyalgia must manage their symptoms through medical treatment and lifestyle changes (1).One way to help symptoms is by following a certain diet.Though little research has been done, some evidence points to certain dietary approaches that may help manage fibromyalgia symptoms. These include (2):Low calorie diets. Weight loss may help with fibromyalgia symptoms, so a low calorie diet may be a good approach.Vegetarian diets. These diets are rich in anti-inflammatory fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes. The strongest evidence is for raw vegetarian diets.Low FODMAP diets. FODMAPS are types of carbs that some people can’t digest. Low FODMAP diets exclude most dairy products, grains, fruits, and vegetables. It’s a very restrictive, highly anti-inflammatory way of eating.A diet high in anti-inflammatory foods may also help manage fibromyalgia symptoms, as chronic inflammation is one of the suspected causes of the disease (3).Regardless, this disease and its symptoms are highly individualized. Different diets may work better or worse depending on the individual. You may benefit from working with a registered dietitian if you’re following a more complex eating pattern, such as a raw vegetarian or low FODMAP diet, to manage your fibromyalgia symptoms.Foods to includeTypes of foods that are typically part of dietary approaches for fibromyalgia include (2):Low calorie: low calorie, high protein, high fiber, or filling foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grainsVegetarian: fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and seeds; some vegetarians may include eggs or dairy products while raw vegetarians eat only uncooked plant foodsLow FODMAP: only foods that are low in FODMAPs, including most meats, rice, some fruits and vegetables, and limited dairy productsYou should also add a variety of anti-inflammatory foods that fit into your preferred eating pattern, as they may help alleviate symptoms. Examples of anti-inflammatory foods include (4, 5):Protein: salmon, eggs, chickpeas, Greek yogurtFruits: bananas, oranges, apples, grapes, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, tomatoes, avocadoVegetables: spinach, kale, zucchini, cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, bell peppers, cucumber, carrotsCarbs: sweet potatoes, brown rice, honeyFats: olive oil, coconut oilHerbs and spices: turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, rosemary, garlic, clovesNote that some of these foods, such as honey and chickpeas, are higher in FODMAPs. As such, avoid them if you’re strictly following a low FODMAP diet.Foods to avoidOn the other hand, foods that are typically avoided in the dietary approaches to fibromyalgia are (2):Low calorie. Exclude empty calories like chips, cookies, cakes, ice cream, sugary drinks, added sugars, and added fats.Vegetarian. All vegetarians exclude meat from their diet. However, raw vegetarians will also exclude cooked foods.Low FODMAP. On the low FODMAP diet, you need to exclude all foods that are high in FODMAPs. This includes wheat, dairy products, beans, garlic, and onions.Anti-inflammatory. To decrease inflammation you should also avoid pro-inflammatory foods, which include highly processed foods, refined carbs, fast food, and processed vegetable oils like soybean oil or corn oil (6). SummaryFibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by muscle pain. Some dietary approaches may help manage its symptoms, including anti-inflammatory, low calorie, raw vegetarian, or low FODMAP diets.Fibromyalgia-friendly recipesThe following recipes are appropriate for various dietary approaches to fibromyalgia, and they all contain anti-inflammatory ingredients like fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices.1.

68,"A condition that’s hard to see It’s not easy to spot fibromyalgia. This is one condition that does not have many visible symptoms. Most symptoms of fibromyalgia — such as pain and fatigue — are hard to see.Fibromyalgia symptoms are also similar to those of other conditions.Because of this, it can be difficult to get an accurate diagnosis and find the treatment you need. Read on to learn how to recognize fibromyalgia.PainPain is a constant presence in fibromyalgia. The pain feels as though it’s starting in the muscles, but there are no signs of damage to the tissues. It’s often described as dull.People with fibromyalgia may be more sensitive than usual to the feeling of pain or to stimuli that cause pain. The discomfort is usually felt all over the body, and it can be made worse by many factors, including stress and a lack of sleep.Fibro fogDo you ever feel as though you cannot clear your head? Confusion, trouble concentrating, and difficulty remembering are all associated with fibro fog, a feeling that people with fibromyalgia sometimes have.What causes fibro fog is not clear, but it may have to do with the effects of pain on the brain or a lack of sleep.Restless legsFibromyalgia pain is not the only symptom of this condition that can steal sleep. Many people with fibromyalgia experience a creeping, crawling feeling in their legs at night. The feeling is so uncomfortable that it makes you want to move, which wakes you out of a deep slumber.The resulting lack of sleep can have a real impact on your ability to function the next day. Learn more about restless leg syndrome.Sleepiness and fatigueWhen you’re in pain, it’s harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. People with fibromyalgia are also more likely to have conditions that interrupt their sleep, such as sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.Even when you can sleep, you get less of the deep rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that helps your body restore itself. Long nights spent lying awake or tossing and turning can lead to morning fatigue.Migraine attacksOne 2015 survey found that 55.8 percent of people with fibromyalgia experienced migraine.During a migraine attack, your head throbs, and you may feel sick to your stomach and throw up. Some people are so sensitive to light and sound during a migraine attack that they have to turn out all the lights and lie down in a dark room until their head pain goes away. Discover other triggers of migraine attacks.Sensitivity to stimuliWhen you have fibromyalgia, the world can be a noisy, bright, and painful place. Fibromyalgia makes you more sensitive to sounds, light, and touch. The slightest pressure on your skin can make you yelp in pain, and you may feel the urge to cover your ears in loud situations, such as concerts. Some people are also sensitive to changes in temperature.Rash and other skin symptomsIn some cases, fibromyalgia can cause a rash. It’s one of the few outward symptoms of the condition. The rash may be accompanied by itching.Fibromyalgia may also cause other skin-related symptoms, such as dryness or hyperhidrosis (excess sweating).Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)When you have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), knowing the location of the nearest restroom can become a serious concern. IBS affects the large intestine and can unexpectedly cause:abdominal painbloatinggasdiarrheaThe condition is more common in people with fibromyalgia, and it can have a serious effect on your everyday life if you do not seek treatment.Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ)Some people with fibromyalgia also have a condition called temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ). TMJ causes pain in the jaw area.If you have TMJ, you’ll notice that your jaw makes snapping or popping noises when you open and close your mouth. You may have trouble opening your mouth all the way to chew or speak. Sometimes TMJ also causes headaches and pain around the ears.What to know about tender pointsTender points (or trigger points) are spots on the body that feel sore when you press firmly on them. They can be located on the back of the:headshoulderselbowshipskneesTender points used to be considered the hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia. Doctors would diagnose fibromyalgia if you felt discomfort in at least 11 out of 18 possible points.In 2016, the American College of Rheumatology revised its diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. Now, healthcare professionals no longer examine tender points before making a fibromyalgia diagnosis. Instead, they consider whether you have musculoskeletal pain in five possible regions.TakeawayFibromyalgia may resemble many other conditions. As a result, it can be difficult to get an accurate diagnosis.However, if you deal with chronic pain, a proper diagnosis is key to improving your quality of life. Fibromyalgia is not fatal, but it can have serious, lifelong effects, especially if it’s left untreated.If you have some of the symptoms above and think you may have fibromyalgia, consider contacting a doctor. They can help you find the treatment you need.",https://www.healthline.com/health/pictures-fibromyalgia-symptoms?utm_source=ReadNext,Fibromyalgia,What Do Fibromyalgia Symptoms Look Like?
69,"Gaucher disease and osteoporosis both affect the bones. Learn how GD impacts your bone health, including its possible connection with osteoporosis.Traditional osteoporosis primarily affects older adults, while Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare metabolic disorder that you’re born with. GD is caused by a genetic mutation inherited by one or both of your parents, resulting in the accumulation of certain lipids throughout the body. There are three types.Bone symptoms, including pain and decreased mobility, are common in people with GD. At least 70% of people with GD type 1 experience bone disease. Decreased bone mineral density — a key component of osteoporosis — may be first seen during childhood or adolescence. Treatment can help prevent joint collapse, secondary degenerative arthritis, and other related complications.How does Gaucher disease affect the bones?GD causes a deficit of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase). This enzyme typically breaks down glucocerebroside, a type of glycolipid (a glucose-containing fatty chemical).When GCase doesn’t break down these lipids, they accumulate in areas like your bone marrow, liver, and spleen. When glycolipids affect your bone marrow, they can impact bone density and lead to bone thinning and fractures.Low GCase levels may also cause bone diseases like osteoporosis. Osteoporosis causes the bones to become weak and more susceptible to fracture.People who have GD type 1 are more likely to develop osteoporosis. GD type 1 is also associated with the following bone-related complications:Osteosclerosis: a disorder characterized by hardened bones and increased bone densityBone crisis: an episode of severe bone pain resulting from reduced blood flow to your bonesLytic lesions: areas where bone tissue has been destroyedAvascular necrosis: a disease characterized by bone degeneration and deformitiesAcute osteomyelitis: a type of bone infection that’s considered rareWhat are the symptoms of Gaucher disease in adults?Some of the most common GD symptoms include:fatigue (due to anemia)bone paineasy bone fractureseasy bruising or bleeding caused by low blood platelets released by your bone marrowswollen belly caused by an enlarged liver or spleenGD type 1 is the most common in the United States and other Western countries, making up an estimated 90% of all cases. GD type 3 is the most common worldwide.Bone diseases in GD type 1 can result in bone pain, fractures from osteoporosis, and skeletal deformities. Brain development in this type is typical, but it’s possible to experience fatigue.Type 1 can cause liver and spleen enlargement and, in rare cases, affect your kidneys and lungs. It’s considered “non-neuronopathic” — it doesn’t affect your spinal cord or brain, the two key central nervous system components.GD type 2 is the least common of the three subtypes and primarily affects young children. Also called acute neuronopathic Gaucher disease, this form causes significant — often fatal — brain damage.GD type 3 involves a combination of symptoms seen in types 1 and 2. It’s slightly more severe than type 1 but less severe than type 2.What treatment options are available for Gaucher disease?GD type 1 — the subtype associated with osteoporosis — is considered mild and is treatable with medications.Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) helps treat GCase enzyme deficiencies so that your body can break down harmful lipids that may accumulate in your bones and organs. ERT is given via infusions every 2 weeks.Another possible option is an oral treatment called substrate reduction therapy (SRT). SRT decreases the overall amount of GCase your body produces.Another goal for bone symptoms associated with GD is to help increase mobility while reducing pain and fractures.Consult with a healthcare professional about dietary changes and possible supplements — such as vitamin D or calcium — that may help prevent further bone loss and related fractures.What’s the life expectancy for someone with Gaucher disease?Bone involvement is primarily seen in GD type 1 but may also be experienced in type 3. Type 1 has the longest life expectancy and is highly treatable.Type 3 emerges during the first decade of life. Type 3 may cause a shortened lifespan, but with treatment, it’s possible to live through your 50s.Type 2 — the least common subtype — primarily affects infants and toddlers. Type 2 is often fatal within the first 2 years of diagnosis. There are currently no treatment options available.While GD is still considered rare, it affects an estimated 1 in every 40,000 live births. Researchers are continuing to investigate the genetic component of this condition as well as possible treatments.Consider talking with your clinician about enrolling in a clinical trial if you have GD-related osteoporosis. Clinical trials contribute to the body of research in this field and may allow you to access lower-cost or no-cost treatment.The bottom lineGD is an inherited disorder that causes a buildup of GCase in your body. If left untreated, this buildup can lead to bone diseases like osteoporosis and other complications involving your bone marrow, liver, and spleen.Whether you have a new diagnosis or have a previous diagnosis and are experiencing bone-related symptoms, consult with a healthcare professional about treatment options. They may also recommend dietary modifications, supplements, and lifestyle changes for additional support.",https://www.healthline.com/health/gauchers-disease-and-osteoporosis,Gaucher's disease,What You Need to Know About Gaucher Disease and Osteoporosis
70,"Symptoms of Gaucher disease can vary greatly from person to person depending on the type of Gaucher disease that a person has. Gaucher disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Symptoms and physical findings associated with Gaucher disease can vary greatly from person to person depending on the type of Gaucher disease a person has. It may impact your: spleenliverbonesheartlungsbrain For some types, symptoms develop in childhood. For other types, symptoms may not develop until adulthood. Read on to learn more about the symptoms of Gaucher disease.Gaucher’s disease symptoms in adultsSymptoms of Gaucher disease in adults vary widely. Some people have severe symptoms and others may have mild or no symptoms.Because there are many different symptoms of Gaucher disease and the presentation of symptoms can be different from person to person, it may take a long time to get an accurate diagnosis. A doctor may first suspect Gaucher disease if you bruise easily or have bleeding symptoms.In addition to bruising easily, other signs or symptoms may include:enlarged liverenlarged spleenswollen stomach (caused by the enlarged organs)anemiabone pain or frequent fracturesfatigueyellow spots in your eyesrespiratory issues (rare)Pompe disease is a similar condition that can also appear in adulthood. However, the two conditions can be distinguished with genetic testing.Gaucher’s disease symptoms in newbornsSymptoms of Gaucher disease in newborn babies may include:enlarged spleenloss of motor skillsmuscle spasmsweak musclescrossed eyestrouble swallowingfailure to gain weight or grow as expectedhigh-pitched breathingseizuresskin issues, like collodion skin (a membrane covering the skin at birth)Conditions similar to Gaucher disease in newborns include: Tay-Sachs diseaseHurler syndromeNiemann-Pick diseasePompe diseaseTo confirm a diagnosis for each of these different conditions, a doctor will use a combination of physical examination, laboratory testing, and genetic analysis. Types of Gaucher diseaseThere are five different types of Gaucher disease. Some occur in adults, while others occur in newborns and infants. Symptoms of the disease can vary depending on the Gaucher type. Type 1Gaucher disease type 1 is the most common type — about 90% of people with Gaucher disease have type 1. It’s most common in Ashkenazi Jews.It’s also called non-neuronopathic Gaucher disease because people with this type of Gaucher disease have normal brain development. It occurs in both children and adults and is caused by not having enough platelets in your blood. People with a mild form of the disease may not have any symptoms.Type 1 is treatable, but not curable. It may increase your risk for: Parkinson’s diseaseLewy body dementiamultiple myelomaType 2Type 2 Gaucher disease is also called acute infantile neuropathic Gaucher disease. It affects newborns and infants, and symptoms usually appear by the time a child is 3 months old.This type of Gaucher disease is caused by the accumulation of glucocerebroside in the brain. This causes severe neurological symptoms, such as: seizurestrouble swallowingmuscle issuesrespiratory issues, such as pneumoniaSkin abnormalities and generalized swelling, known as hydrops, may be present in newborns who are severely affected by type 2 Gaucher disease.This type of Gaucher disease is fatal. The average lifespan is just under 1 year, though some babies will survive into their second or third year of life. Type 3Type 3 Gaucher disease is generally between type 1 and type 2 in terms of severity. Symptoms usually appear before age 10 and often before age 2. Type 3 Gaucher disease is also known as chronic neuronopathic Gaucher disease.Like type 2 Gaucher disease, it causes neurological symptoms, but these symptoms progress much more slowly in people with type 3. The severity of neurological symptoms also varies much more in people with type 3 Gaucher disease.Type 3 Gaucher disease is treatable but usually leads to a shortened life expectancy. Some people may only live into their 20s, while others may live into their 50s. People with this condition may need assistance with daily life as they get older and neurological symptoms progress.Perinatal-lethal form Also known as fetal-neonatal Gaucher disease, perinatal-lethal Gaucher disease is a very severe form of this condition. This is also the least common type.This type of Gaucher disease causes fluid buildup throughout the body, bleeding in the brain, skin scaling, and fixed joints. It’s very severe and generally causes death before or shortly after birth. Cardiovascular formThe cardiovascular form of Gaucher disease mostly affects the heart and causes heart valves to harden. It can also cause symptoms similar to those of type 1, including bone disease, spleen enlargement, and eye issues.Gaucher disease symptoms and diagnosisYour doctor may suspect that you have Gaucher disease if you have anemia that isn’t otherwise explained and bruise easily, especially if you also have bone fractures. However, symptoms are not enough to make a diagnosis of Gaucher disease.To confirm diagnosis of Gaucher disease, your doctor may do the following tests and research:a physical examyour medical history, including a history of your symptomsyour family history, since Gaucher disease is genetican enzyme assay, also called a BGL blood test, to look for acid beta-glucosidase in your blood cells or skin cellsgenetic tests using blood or saliva, if your blood tests show low enzyme activity (these tests look for the mutations that cause Gaucher disease and can confirm a diagnosis)TakeawayGaucher disease symptoms vary widely from person to person. When they appear in adulthood, they usually cause unexplained bleeding and bruising, a swollen stomach from an enlarged spleen and liver, bone fractures, and more. In newborns, Gaucher disease can cause severe neurological symptoms.If you have unexplained bruising or bleeding, or if you have bone pain or fractures, talk with your doctor, especially if you have a family history of Gaucher disease or any of its symptoms. They can run tests to find an accurate diagnosis and the treatment you may need.",https://www.healthline.com/health/gaucher-disease-symptoms,Gaucher's disease,What Symptoms Can You Expect with Gaucher Disease?
71,"Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder in which a person lacks an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GBA).CausesGaucher disease is rare in the general population. People of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are more likely to have this disease.It is an autosomal recessive disease. This means that the mother and father must both pass one abnormal copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease. A parent who carries an abnormal copy of the gene but doesn't have the disease is called a silent carrier.The lack of the GBA causes harmful substances to build up in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow. These substances prevent cells and organs from working properly.There are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease:Type 1 is most common. It involves bone disease, anemia, an enlarged spleen and low platelets (thrombocytopenia). Type 1 affects both children and adults. It is most common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.Type 2 usually begins in infancy with severe neurologic involvement. This form can lead to rapid, early death.Type 3 may cause liver, spleen, and brain problems. People with this type may live into adulthood. SymptomsBleeding because of low platelet count is the most common symptom seen in Gaucher disease.

72," What is Fabry disease?Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, inherited disease. It’s progressive and can be life-threatening. People with FD have a damaged gene that leads to a shortage of an essential enzyme. The shortage results in a buildup of specific proteins in the body’s cells, causing damage to the:heartlungskidneysskinbrainstomachThe disease affects both men and women in all ethnic groups, but men are usually more severely affected.There are two types of FD. Type 1 FD, also known as classic FD, starts in childhood and is less common than type 2, which has a later onset. An estimated 1 out of 117,000 people has FD.FD is named for Johannes Fabry, a doctor in Germany who first described its symptoms in 1898. It’s also known as Anderson-Fabry disease, for William Anderson, a British doctor who also noted it in that same year. Other names for FD are:galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene deficiencyenzyme alpha-galactosidase A deficiencyangiokeratoma corporis diffusumangiokeratoma diffuseceramide trihexosidase deficiency Fabry disease symptomsFD has many different symptoms, making diagnosis difficult. Symptoms can vary between men and women, and between type 1 and type 2 FD.Symptoms of type 1 FDEarly symptoms of type 1 FD include:Burning or tingling pain in the hands and feet. In males this can occur as early as 2 to 8 years old. In females it occurs later in childhood or adolescence. Episodes of intense pain, which can last from minutes to days, are called “Fabry crises.”Lack of sweat production. This affects more males than females.Skin rash. This reddish-purple rash is slightly raised and occurs between the belly button and the knees. It’s called angiokeratoma.Stomach problems. This includes cramps, gas, and diarrhea.Abnormal corneas. Blood vessels in the eyes may have a changed appearance, but this doesn’t affect vision.General tiredness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and heat intolerance. Males may have swelling in their feet and legs.As type 1 FD progresses, symptoms become more serious. When people with type 1 reach their 30s and 40s, they can develop kidney disease, heart disease, and stroke.Symptoms of type 2 FDPeople with type 2 FD also develop problems in these areas, although usually later in life, in their 30s to 60s.Serious FD symptoms vary from person to person and can include:A progressive decrease in kidney function, advancing to kidney failure.Heart enlargement, angina (heart-related chest pain), irregular heartbeat, thickening of the heart muscle, and eventually heart failure.Strokes, occurring in some men and women with FD in their 40s. This may be more common in women with FD.Stomach problems. About 50-60 percent of women with FD may have pain and diarrhea.Other signs of FD include:hearing lossringing in the earslung diseaseintolerance of strenuous exercisefever Pictures of Fabry disease What causes Fabry disease?Who inherits FDA specific gene mutation causes FD. You inherit the damaged gene from your parents. The damaged gene is located on the X chromosome, one of the two chromosomes that determine your sex. Males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes.A man with the FD gene mutation on the X chromosome will always pass it on to his daughters, but not to his sons. The sons get the Y chromosome, which doesn’t have the damaged gene.A woman with the FD mutation on one X chromosome has a 50 percent chance of passing it on to her sons and daughters. If her son gets the X chromosome with the FD mutation, he will inherit FD.Because a daughter has two X chromosomes, she may have less severe FD symptoms. This is because not all of her body’s cells will activate the X chromosome that carries the defect. Whether or not the damaged X chromosome is activated occurs early in your development and remains that way for the rest of your life.How genetic mutations lead to FDFD is caused by as many as 370 mutations in the GLA gene. Particular mutations tend to run in families.The GLA gene controls the production of a particular enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down a molecule in the cells known as globotriaosylceramide (GL-3).When the GLA gene is damaged, the enzyme that breaks GL-3 down can’t function properly. As a result, GL-3 builds up in the body’s cells. Over time, this fatty buildup damages the cell walls of blood vessels in the:skinnervous systemheartkidneysThe degree of damage FD causes depends on how severe the mutation in the GLA gene is. That’s why FD symptoms can vary from person to person. How is Fabry disease diagnosed?FD can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. Symptoms are often present long before a diagnosis. Many people are not diagnosed until they have an FD crisis.Type 1 FD is most often diagnosed by doctors on the basis of the child’s symptoms. In adults, FD is often diagnosed when they’re being tested or treated for heart or kidney problems.An FD diagnosis for males can be confirmed by a blood test that measures the amount of the damaged enzyme. For females, this test isn’t sufficient, because the damaged enzyme may seem normal even though some organs are damaged. A genetic test for the defective GLA gene is necessary to confirm whether a female has FD.For families with a known history of FD, prenatal tests can be performed to determine if a baby has FD.Early diagnosis is important. FD is a progressive disease, which means that symptoms get worse over time. Early treatment can help. Fabry disease treatment optionsFD can cause a wide variety of symptoms. If you have FD, you’ll probably see specialists for some of these symptoms. In general, treatment will aim at managing symptoms, relieving pain, and preventing further damage.Once you’ve been diagnosed with FD, it’s important to regularly see your doctor to monitor your symptoms. People with FD are advised not to smoke.Here are some FD treatment options:Enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT)ERT is now a first-line treatment recommended for all people with FD. Agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme) has been used since 2003, when it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It’s given intravenously, or through an IV.Pain managementPain management can involve avoiding activities that might bring on symptoms, such as strenuous exercise or temperature changes. Your doctor may also prescribe medications such as diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin) or carbamazapine (Tegretol). These are taken daily for pain reduction and prevention of FD crises.For your kidneyA low-protein, low-sodium diet may help if you have a mildly reduced kidney function. If your kidney function gets worse, you may need kidney dialysis. In dialysis, a machine is used to filter your blood three times a week or more, depending on what type of dialysis you’re on and how much you need. A kidney transplant may also be necessary.As-needed treatmentsHeart problems will be treated as they are for people without FD. Your doctor may prescribe medications to manage the condition. Your doctor may also prescribe treatments to reduce the risk of stroke. For stomach problems, your doctor may prescribe medication or a special diet. Complications of Fabry diseaseOne potential complication of FD is end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD can be deadly if you aren’t treated with dialysis or a kidney transplant. Almost all males with FD develop ESRD. But only about 10 percent of females with FD develop ESRD.For people who are treated to control ESRD, heart disease is a major cause of death. Fabry disease outlook and life expectancyFD can’t be cured, but it can be treated. Awareness of FD is increasing. ERT is a relatively new treatment that helps stabilize symptoms and lower the occurrence of FD crises. Research is ongoing for other treatment possibilities. Gene replacement therapy is in a clinical trial. Another approach in the research phase, called chaperone therapy, uses small molecules to stop the damaged enzyme.Life expectancy for people with FD is lower than that of the general U.S. population. For males, it’s 58.2 years. For females, it’s 75.4 years.A frequently overlooked FD complication is depression. It can be helpful to reach out to other people who understand. There are several organizations for people with FD which have resources that can help both people with FD and their families:Fabry Support and Information GroupNational Fabry Disease FoundationInternational Center for Fabry Disease",https://www.healthline.com/health/fabry-disease,Fabry,Understanding Fabry Disease
73,"What is Fabry disease?Fabry disease (also known as alpha-galactosidase-A deficiency) is an inherited neurological disorder that occurs when the enzyme alpha-galactosidase-A cannot efficiently break down fatty materials known as lipids into smaller components that provide energy to the body. The mutated gene allows lipids to build up to harmful levels in the body's autonomic nervous system (the part of the nervous system that controls involuntary functions such as breathing and heartbeat), as well as in the eyes, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. Males are primarily affected, although a milder and more variable form is common in females. Onset of symptoms is usually during childhood or adolescence. Neurological signs include:Burning pain in the arms and legs, which worsens in hot weather or following exercise The buildup of excess material in the clear layers of the cornea (resulting in clouding but no change in vision)Impaired circulation that may lead to stroke or heart attack due to fatty storage in blood vessel walls Other symptoms include:Heart enlargementProgressive kidney impairment leading to renal failureGastrointestinal difficultiesDecreased sweatingFeverAngiokeratomas (small, non-cancerous, reddish-purple elevated spots on the skin) may develop on the lower part of the trunk of the body and become more numerous with ageEnzyme replacement can reduce lipid storage, ease pain, and preserve organ function in some people with Fabry disease. Drugs are often prescribed to treat pain and gastrointestinal distress that accompanies Fabry disease but do not treat the disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved migalastat (Galafold) as an oral medication for adults with Fabry disease who have a certain genetic mutation. Anti-platelet medications can help prevent strokes and medications that lower blood pressure can slow the decline of kidney function in people with Fabry disease. Some individuals may require kidney transplants or dialysis. file-medicalLearn About Clinical TrialsClinical trials are studies that allow us to learn more about disorders and improve care. They can help connect patients with new and upcoming treatment options.How can I or my loved one help improve care for people with Fabry disease?Consider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about Fabry disease and related disorders. Clinical research uses human volunteers to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease. All types of volunteers are needed—those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease—of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them.

74,"DescriptionFabry disease is an inherited disorder that results from the buildup of a type of fat, called globotriaosylceramide, in the body's cells. Beginning in childhood, this buildup causes signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. Characteristic features of Fabry disease include episodes of pain, particularly in the hands and feet (acroparesthesias); clusters of small, dark red spots on the skin called angiokeratomas; a decreased ability to sweat (hypohidrosis); cloudiness or streaks in the front part of the eye (corneal opacity or corneal verticillata); problems with the gastrointestinal system; ringing in the ears (tinnitus); and hearing loss. Additional signs and symptoms are possible, which can vary among affected individuals.Fabry disease also involves potentially life-threatening complications such as progressive kidney failure, heart failure, and stroke. Some affected individuals have milder forms of the disorder that appear later in life and typically involve only the heart, kidneys, or blood vessels in the brain.FrequencyFabry disease affects an estimated 1 in 1,000 to 9,000 people. Milder, late-onset forms of the disorder are probably more common than the classic, severe form.CausesFabry disease is caused by variants (also known as mutations) in the GLA gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures that serve as recycling centers within cells. Alpha-galactosidase A normally breaks down a fatty substance called globotriaosylceramide. Variants in the GLA gene alter the structure and function of the enzyme, preventing it from breaking down this substance effectively.  As a result, globotriaosylceramide builds up in cells throughout the body, particularly cells lining blood vessels in the skin and cells in the kidneys, heart, and nervous system.  The progressive accumulation of this substance damages cells, leading to the varied signs and symptoms of Fabry disease.GLA gene variants that result in an absence of alpha-galactosidase A activity lead to the classic, severe form of Fabry disease. Variants that decrease but do not eliminate the enzyme's activity usually cause the milder, late-onset forms of Fabry disease that typically affect only the heart, kidneys, or blood vessels in the brain.Learn more about the gene associated with Fabry diseaseGLAInheritanceThis condition is inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the altered gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in each cell. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the GLA gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. Because females have two copies of the X chromosome, one altered copy of the gene in each cell usually leads to less severe symptoms in females than in males, or rarely may cause no symptoms at all.Unlike other X-linked disorders, Fabry disease causes significant medical problems in many females who have one altered copy of the GLA gene. These women may experience many of the classic features of the disorder, including nervous system abnormalities, kidney problems, chronic pain, and fatigue. They also have an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure.  The signs and symptoms of Fabry disease usually begin later in life and are milder in females than in their affected male relatives.A small percentage of females who carry a variant in one copy of the GLA gene never develop signs and symptoms of Fabry disease.Other Names for This ConditionAlpha-galactosidase A deficiency Anderson-Fabry disease Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum Angiokeratoma diffuse Ceramide trihexosidase deficiency Fabry's disease GLA deficiency Hereditary dystopic lipidosisAdditional Information & ResourcesGenetic Testing InformationGenetic Testing Registry: Fabry disease Genetic and Rare Diseases Information CenterFabry disease Patient Support and Advocacy ResourcesDisease InfoSearchNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)Research Studies from ClinicalTrials.govClinicalTrials.gov Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIMFABRY DISEASEScientific Articles on PubMedPubMed ReferencesDeegan PB, Baehner AF, Barba Romero MA, Hughes DA, Kampmann C, Beck M;European FOS Investigators.

75,"            Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disorder, is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. The gold standard for diagnosis is decreased acid beta-glucosidase activity in the lymphocytes or fibroblasts; molecular analysis of mutations allows for some prognostication of disease severity. Prenatal diagnosis and carrier testing for at-risk families are currently available. There is tremendous phenotypic heterogeneity in the non-neuronopathic form (type I), ranging from clinically asymptomatic to massive hepatomegaly, hypersplenism, growth retardation in children and extensive involvement of bone and lungs. Presence on one allele of the most common mutation, N370S, which is the most prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews for whom there is a predilection for Gaucher disease, is protective of neurological involvement. Some mutations, such as 84GG and IVS2+1, are associated with more severe disease manifestations when appearing as compound heterozygotes with N370S, but when occurring in the homozygous state are not compatible with life. Other mutations, such as L444P, are associated with severe non-neurological disease when occurring as compound heterozygotes with N370S, but when occurring in the homozygous state may be predictive of neurological disease of either acute (type II) or subacute (type III) forms. In the past decade, enzyme replacement therapy has become available which has resulted in a reduction in liver and spleen volume and consequently improved anemia and thrombocytopenia in most patients. It has also engendered catch-up growth in many children, induced improvement in lung involvement secondary to Gaucher disease, and to some extent ameliorated episodes of bone pain. By virtue of treatment, many children who may have been severely affected no longer need to undergo splenectomy to treat hypersplenism, and therefore they are not at risk of bone involvement consequent to the loss of the preferred reservoir for lipid-laden 'Gaucher cells'. However, enzyme treatment is ineffective in reversing neurological signs, requires a lifelong commitment to intravenous infusions, thereby reducing quality of life, and is relatively expensive for many national health schemes. Hence, alternative forms of treatment, such as substrate balance, are being explored. Symptomatic management, including orthopedic surgery, pain relief for bone pain and even splenectomy, still has importance for patients with Gaucher disease. In addition, there is the potential for bone marrow transplantation and, in the future, gene therapy to be curative, particularly for patients with the neuronopathic forms.

76,"            Fabry disease is a frequent lysosomal storage disorder secondary to the deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. This X-linked genetic disease realizes progressive and systemic manifestations that affect both male and female. Fabry disease may present as ""classical"", as ""late-onset"" or ""non-classical"" forms. Symptoms and organ involvements of classical Fabry disease are acral pain crisis, cornea verticillata, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, stroke and chronic kidney disease with proteinuria. Other common symptoms are often poorly recognized, such as gastrointestinal or ear involvements. In classical Fabry disease, symptoms first appear during childhood or during teenage years in males, but later in females. Patients with non-classical or late-onset Fabry disease have delayed manifestations or a single-organ involvement. Diagnosis is therefore difficult when classical organ involvements are missing, in paucisymptomatic patients or in late-onset forms. Recognition of Fabry disease is important because effective treatments are available. They have to be prescribed early. In male, diagnosis is made with alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity dosage in leukocyte, that is very low or null in classical forms and under 30 percent in late-onset forms. Diagnosis is more challenging in females who may express normal residual enzyme activity. Other plasmatic biomarkers, such as lyso-globotriaosylceramide are interesting, especially in females. In this review, we aimed to summarize main clinical manifestations of Fabry disease to know when to evoke Fabry disease and propose a practical diagnosis algorithm to know how to diagnose.

77,"What is EDS?Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of inherited conditions that cause abnormal collagen function. They can affect connective tissues that support and structure the skin, joints, bones, blood vessels, and organs.People with EDS may experience increased joint mobility and have stretchy, fragile skin that’s prone to breaking. Each case of EDS is different, and there’s no singular cure for the condition.Types of EDSThere are 13 types of EDS, all of which produce different symptoms and health outcomes.For example, vascular EDS affects the cardiovascular system, whereas dermatosparaxis EDS produces more skin-centric symptoms.The 13 types of EDS are: hypermobileclassicclassic-likecardiac-valvularvasculararthrochalasiadermatosparaxiskyphoscolioticbrittle corneaspondylodysplasticmusculocontracturalmyopathicperiodontalHypermobile and classic are the most common types of EDS.What are the symptoms of EDS?Your EDS symptoms will vary depending on what type of EDS you have. The severity of symptoms will also be different between people experiencing the same type of EDS.However, some symptoms are more common across cases than others.Loose jointsOne common symptom of EDS is joint hypermobility, which is when there’s a greater range of movement in a joint than usual. EDS can affect collagen function in the tendons and cartilage in your joints, which can lead to hypermobility. EDS can affect all of the joints in the body.In mild cases, a person will be able to move joints in a greater range of movement than normal and may experience light pain during activities. In more severe cases, a person may be at a greater risk of joint dislocations and joint instability.Joint looseness can affect muscle and nerve development in young children.Elastic skinA lack of collagen in the skin can lead people with EDS to have stretchy, almost elastic skin. Skin elasticity affects all forms of EDS except vascular EDS.Classic EDS and dermatosparaxis EDS typically affect the skin the most. If you have dermatosparaxis EDS, you may find that your skin doesn’t bounce back as it should, and you may experience loose skin or skin folds.Fragile skinWhen living with EDS, you may also find that your skin is fragile. You may be more prone to cuts, bruises, and wounds may heal slowly. As with skin elasticity, this is due to collagen deficiencies in the skin.People with classic EDS may experience wounds that open with little bleeding and leave visible scars that widen over time. Some people refer to these as “cigarette paper scars.”Other symptoms of classic EDS include:skin that bruises easilyredundant skin folds on the eyesmuscle painmuscle fatiguebenign growths on pressure areas, like elbows and kneesheart valve problemsSymptoms of hypermobile EDS (hEDS)Hypermobile EDS accounts for around 80 to 90 percent of EDS cases. Its primary symptom is loose or weak joints. If you have hypermobile EDS, you may also experience any of the following.loose jointseasy bruisingmuscle painmuscle fatiguechronic degenerative joint diseasepremature osteoarthritischronic painheart valve problemsSymptoms of vascular EDSVascular EDS primarily affects the cardiovascular system and is a severe health condition. Symptoms of vascular EDS include:fragile blood vesselsthin skintransparent skinthin lipssunken cheekscollapsed lungheart valve problemsWhat causes EDS?EDS affects 1 in 5,000 people worldwide and 1 in 2,500 – 1 in 5,00 births. In most cases, a person will inherit the condition from their parents.In rare cases a person may develop EDS due to spontaneous mutations in genes involved in collagen function.EDS diagnosisDoctors may use a series of tests to diagnose EDS or rule out similar conditions.These tests can include:mobility assessmentsgenetic testsskin biopsyechocardiogramsTo determine the genetic origin, a doctor may take a blood sample from your arm and test it for mutations in certain genes. They may then use a skin biopsy to check for abnormalities in collagen function. This involves removing a small skin sample and checking it under a microscope.An echocardiogram uses sound waves to create moving images of the heart. This will show the doctor if there are any abnormalities present.How is EDS treated?The presentation and symptoms of EDS will vary on a case-by-case basis. As a result, there’s typically no singular treatment for these conditions, and your EDS plan will depend on your symptoms.Treatment will revolve around minimizing pain, reducing the risk of serious complications, and assisting your day-to-day life.However, in most instances, a person with EDS will undergo some of the following treatments:physical therapy to rehabilitate joints and musclessurgery to repair damaged jointsdrugs to minimize painAdditional treatment options may be available depending on the amount of pain you’re experiencing or any additional symptoms.PreventionEDS is normally a genetic condition, and you cannot prevent it. However, if you have EDS, you may be able to prevent further complications and improve your general quality of life.The following may help you to manage your condition:avoiding contact sportsavoiding lifting weightsusing sunscreen to protect the skinavoiding harsh soaps that may overdry the skin or cause allergic reactionsusing assistive devices to minimize pressure on your jointsAlso, if your child has EDS, follow these steps to prevent injuries and protect their joints. In addition, put adequate padding on your child before they ride a bike or are learning to walk.Potential complications of EDSComplications of EDS may include:chronic joint painjoint dislocationearly onset arthritisslow healing of wounds, leading to prominent scarringsurgical wounds that have a hard time healingOutlook and life expectancyThe patient outlook varies between the types of EDS. People with many forms of EDS, such as classic and hypermobile EDS, may see no significant reduction in lifespan. These conditions may affect day-to-day activities but don’t increase the risk of premature death.However, vascular and kyphoscoliosis EDS do carry a reduced life expectancy. Due to its impact on the cardiovascular system, the median life expectancy of people with vascular EDS is 48 years.If you suspect you have EDS based on symptoms you’re experiencing, it’s important to visit your doctor. They will diagnose you with a few tests or by ruling out other similar conditions. Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan.",https://www.healthline.com/health/ehlers-danlos-syndrome,hEDS,What Are Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS)?
78,"Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory disease. Common symptoms include a distinctive skin rash, and inflammatory myopathy, or inflamed muscles, causing muscle weakness. It’s one of only three known inflammatory myopathies. Dermatomyositis can affect both adults and children. There’s no cure for this condition, but symptoms can be managed.SymptomsIn most cases, the first symptom is a distinctive skin rash on the face, eyelids, chest, nail cuticle areas, knuckles, knees, or elbows. The rash is patchy and usually a bluish-purple color.A rash on the chest is known as a “shawl sign” because it appears in a shawl-like pattern. A rash on the hands is known as “mechanic’s hands“ because it makes the skin appear rough and dirty.You may also have muscle weakness that gets worse over weeks or months. This muscle weakness usually starts in your neck, arms, or hips and can be felt on both sides of your body.Other symptoms you might experience are:muscle painmuscle tendernessproblems swallowinglung problemshard calcium deposits underneath the skin, which is mostly seen in childrenfatigueunintentional weight lossfeverThere is a subtype of dermatomyositis that includes the rash but not muscle weakness. This is known as amyopathic dermatomyositis.CausesThe exact cause of dermatomyositis isn’t known. However, it has many similarities to an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease occurs when your body’s disease-fighting cells, called antibodies, attack your healthy cells. Having a compromised immune system may also contribute to getting the disease. For example, having a viral infection or cancer may compromise your immune system and lead to the development of dermatomyositis.About 15 to 30 percent of dermatomyositis cases are associated with malignancy such as breast, ovary, or lung cancer. This is known as paraneoplastic dermatomyositis, meaning the disease is associated with but not directly related to a tumor.Risk factorsAnyone can develop dermatomyositis. However, it’s most common in adults between the ages of 40 and 60 and children between the ages of 5 and 15. The disease affects women twice as often as men. It affects more Black Americans than white Americans.Image of dermatomyositisShare on PinterestDiagnosis of dermatomyositisYour doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history and perform a physical exam. Dermatomyositis is an easier inflammatory muscle disease to diagnose because of the autoimmune rash associated with it. Your doctor may also order:an MRI to look for abnormal musclesan electromyography (EMG) to record electrical impulses that control your musclesa blood analysis to check your levels of muscle enzymes and autoantibodies, which are antibodies that attack normal cellsa muscle biopsy to look for inflammation and other problems associated with the disease in a sample of muscle tissuea skin biopsy to look for changes caused by the disease in a skin sampleTreatment for dermatomyositisFor most people, there’s no cure for dermatomyositis. Treatment can improve the condition of your skin and muscle weakness. Available treatments include medication, physical therapy, and surgery. CorticosteroidsCorticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, are the preferred method of treatment in most cases. You can take them by mouth as well as apply them to your skin. Corticosteroids lower the response of your immune system, which reduces the number of inflammation-causing antibodies. For some people, especially children, symptoms may resolve completely after a treatment course with corticosteroids. This is called remission. Remission may be long lasting, and sometimes even permanent. Corticosteroids, especially in high doses, shouldn’t be used for extended periods of time because of their potential side effects. Your doctor will most likely start you on a high dose and then gradually lower it. Some people can eventually stop taking corticosteroids completely if their symptoms go away and stay away after stopping the medication.If corticosteroids alone don’t improve your symptoms, your doctor might prescribe other medications to suppress your immune system.Corticosteroid-sparing medications are used to reduce the side effects of corticosteroids. Drugs such as azathioprine and methotrexate may be used if your case is advanced or if you have any complications from corticosteroids.Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)If you have dermatomyositis, your body is producing antibodies that target your skin and muscles. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) uses healthy antibodies to block these antibodies. IVIG consists of a mixture of antibodies that have been collected from thousands of healthy people who have donated their blood. These antibodies are given to you through an IV. Additional treatmentsYour doctor might suggest additional treatments, such as:physical therapy that improves and preserves your muscle strength, along with preventing loss of muscle tissuean antimalarial medication, hydroxychloroquine, for a persistent autoimmune rashsurgery to remove calcium depositsmedications to help with painPossible complications of dermatomyositisThe muscle weakness and skin problems linked with dermatomyositis can cause a number of problems. Some common complications are:skin ulcersgastric ulcersdifficulty breathinglung infectionsproblems swallowingmalnutritionweight lossDermatomyositis can also be associated with conditions such as:Raynaud’s phenomenonmyocarditisinterstitial lung diseaseother connective tissue diseasesincreased risk of developing cancersOutlookAlthough dermatomyositis may resolve in about 20 percent of adults who have it, for most people it can’t be cured. The symptoms can be treated, however. Your doctor will create a treatment plan for you that will help you manage your symptoms.In addition, healthy lifestyle habits have had a positive impact on many people with dermatomyositis and other types of myositis. Among these habits are regular exercise to help reduce inflammation and an anti-inflammatory diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, and avoids foods like processed meats and sugary desserts.",https://www.healthline.com/health/dermatomyositis,Dermatomyositis,Dermatomyositis: What Is It?
79,"Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an autoimmune disease that affects children. It occurs when the immune system attacks the skin, muscles, and blood vessels. JDM is a rare, lifelong condition that requires diagnosis and treatment from a doctor. A customized management plan that includes medications, therapies, and certain lifestyle habits may relieve symptoms and even lead to remission.What is juvenile dermatomyositis?JDM is a chronic condition in children. It occurs when the immune system doesn’t work as it should. This is also known as an autoimmune disease. In JDM, the immune system attacks muscle and skin cells as well as blood vessels. This causes inflammation that results in a child’s symptoms.JDM is a very rare condition. It affects just 3,000 to 5,000 children in the United States, or 3 in 1 million children. Doctors generally diagnose the condition in children who are elementary school aged or young teenagers.Similar conditions, like juvenile myositis and juvenile polymyositis, do not affect the skin.JDM can progress over time. At first, a child may have mild signs and symptoms that worsen over time. JDM that goes untreated or does not respond to treatment may become very severe and life threatening. What are the symptoms of juvenile dermatomyositis?JDM can appear in a number of ways. You may notice a skin rash first. The condition may then affect the muscles and cause other symptoms. The onset of JDM can occur rapidly. Symptoms can also come and go.Skin rashThis will appear red or purple. It could be very faint. You may notice it on your child’s:eyelidscheeks (may look like a sunburn)fingernails (may look pink)knuckles (may look scaly)elbows (may look scaly)knees (may look scaly)anklestrunkMuscle weaknessFollowing a skin rash, you may notice the following issues related to your child’s muscles:weakness at the torso or at parts of the body near it, including the neck, shoulders, hips, and thighsproblems getting up off the floor or out of a seatdifficulty climbing stairsfallsdifficulty swallowingweakening voicegastrointestinal (GI) upsetwalking on tip toes if ankles are affectedThese symptoms may begin within days of noticing a skin rash or many months after it appears.Usually, JDM affects the muscles on both sides of the body.Other symptomsWhile skin rash and muscle weakness are primary symptoms of JDM, you may notice others, too, like:fatigue that causes a child to tire easily or have a general lack of energyfevervasculitisjoint or muscle painlimited range of motion in joints because of shortened musclestender musclesweight losshard, white lumps under the skin near elbows, knees, and knucklesstomach ulcersloss of body fatWhat causes juvenile dermatomyositis?There’s no confirmed cause of JDM. However, the condition may be linked to:genetics, particularly if your family medical history includes autoimmune diseasesthe immune system and certain viruses that trigger itthe environmentHow is juvenile dermatomyositis diagnosed?If your child has symptoms of JDM, bring them to their pediatrician for a checkup and diagnosis. Diagnosing JDM may include:a medical history and family medical historya physical exam, including looking for skin rashes, muscle weakness, and changes to the blood vessels around the nailslaboratory blood tests that measure muscle enzymes and certain antibodiesimaging tests, like an MRI, to observe muscle swellinga biopsy to examine a small piece of muscleThese tests will allow your child’s doctor to get a full view of the condition. Understanding the severity of it and the way it is affecting your child’s body will help them create a treatment plan.What is the treatment for juvenile dermatomyositis?Treatment for JDM can range from person to person. The goals of treatment are to stop the progression of JDM by controlling or reducing muscle inflammation and improving muscle movement and strength. The condition is chronic, but treatments can improve the quality of life and may even lead to the end of symptoms, called remission. Treatment teamYour child’s primary care doctor may add specialists to the treatment plan, such as a:rheumatologistdermatologistphysical therapistregistered dietitianspeech therapistMedicationsThere are a wide number of medications that may help JDM, such as:corticosteroids that reduce swelling like prednisone, which should be used for a short time because of harmful side effectsother medications that suppress the immune system but are less harmful than steroids in the long term, such as: methotrexatehydroxychloroquineanti-TNF drugsrituximabintravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)LifestyleDoctors also recommend making the following lifestyle modifications if your child has JDM:Sun protection: Use sunscreen and wear sun-protective clothing, like hats, long-sleeve shirts, and pants.Diet: Eat a nutritious and balanced diet that accounts for any difficulties with swallowing.Exercise: Find movement your child enjoys to keep their body functioning well, but that also accounts for any mobility limitations.Stress management: Try meditation, mindfulness, or deep breathing to reduce stress.One 2019 study described life with JDM as a “rollercoaster.” Researchers found that children with JDM said they felt:differentsicksteroidalscareduncertain These feelings are related to their symptoms, treatment, and general life as a child. Make sure to consider your child’s emotional needs during treatment. Their pediatrician can connect you with mental health support if needed.What are the risk factors for juvenile dermatomyositis?Risk factors for JDM include:having family members with autoimmune conditionsbeing female (the condition affects twice as many girls as boys)having other conditions like diabetes, celiac disease, or arthritisWhat’s the outlook for people who have juvenile dermatomyositis?Although JDM is not curable, treatments can manage symptoms and prevent them from getting worse. A child may even experience remission from symptoms with the right treatment and lifestyle.There are times when treatments do not prevent the progression of symptoms. JDM can lead to permanent disability or death. This is why it is very important to seek treatment right away.Bottom lineJDM is a rare, chronic condition that affects the skin, muscles, and blood vessels in a child. There are many treatments available to manage symptoms. You will need to rely on a medical team for treatment as well as adopt certain habits that keep your child’s body well nourished and strong.",https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-disorders/juvenile-dermatomyositis,Dermatomyositis,What to Know If Your Child Has Juvenile Dermatomyositis
80,"Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory disease that mainly affects the muscles and skin. While there’s no cure for dermatomyositis, the condition can be managed through measures like medications and physical therapy.Having dermatomyositis is associated with various complications and risks. One of these is an increased likelihood of developing cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC).In this article, we take a closer look at dermatomyositis, its association with SCLC, and more.What is dermatomyositis?Dermatomyositis (DM) is a type of condition called an inflammatory myopathy, which is marked by muscle inflammation and weakness. It’s believed to be an autoimmune disease, which is when the immune system attacks healthy tissues.What causes DM is unknown, but is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. What we do know is that DM is very rare. It’s estimated to occur in only 9.63 out of 1 million people.Symptoms of dermatomyositisOne of the main symptoms of DM is muscle weakness. This tends to get worse over time and most often affects muscles close to your core, such as those of the neck, shoulders and upper arms, and hips.As it worsens, muscle weakness can begin to impact certain movements, such as walking, climbing stairs, or lifting your arms over your head. When muscles in the neck are affected, it can lead to trouble talking or swallowing.In addition to muscle symptoms, people with DM also have a variety of skin symptoms, including:specific types of skin rashes, such as heliotrope rashlight sensitivityskin pigmentation changesitchingOther potential symptoms of DM include:muscle painjoint pain or swellingnail changesrespiratory symptoms like cough or shortness of breathfatiguefeverunintentional weight lossCan dermatomyositis cause small cell lung cancer?People with DM are estimated to have a 6-fold higher risk of developing cancer compared with the general population. In fact, it’s estimated that 10% to 25% of DM cases are associated with cancer.Cancer is often diagnosed at the same time as DM or shortly after. The risk is highest in the first year after a DM diagnosis and continues to be so for up to 5 years. However, even after this, people with DM still have a high cancer risk compared with the general population.Lung cancer is often linked with DM. A small older study found that the most common type of lung cancer associated with DM was SCLC.SCLC is one of two main types of lung cancer, making up about 10% to 15% of all lung cancers. It often grows and spreads faster than non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the other main type of lung cancer.What’s the link between dermatomyositis and small cell lung cancer?The exact cause-and-effect link between DM and cancer, including SCLC, isn’t fully understood. Some experts believe that DM is a type of paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes often happen when there’s a dysfunctional immune response to a tumor. They can also occur when a tumor produces a hormone or other peptide. Here’s an example of how that might happen with DM:DM is associated with the presence of various antibodies that attack healthy tissue. One of these is an antibody against TIF1-gamma. This antibody targets markers that are mainly present in the muscles and skin.Normally, the TIF1-gamma protein in your body is a tumor suppressor, meaning it’s involved in inhibiting cell growth. However, when it becomes mutated it can mean that cells are free to grow and divide out of control.It’s possible that antibodies to mutated TIF1-gamma proteins in cancer cells could cross-react with normal TIF1-gamma proteins in the muscles and skin, leading to DM. This could explain why DM and cancer often happen so closely together.Anti-TIF1-gamma antibodies are associated with the development of cancer in DM. In fact, up to 84% of people with anti-TIF1-gamma antibodies have DM that’s associated with cancer.What other cancers are linked to dermatomyositis?In addition to SCLC, DM is linked to several other types of cancer. These include:other types of lung cancer, such as NSCLCovarian cancerstomach cancerpancreatic cancerbreast cancercervical cancerbladder cancercolorectal cancernasopharyngeal cancerlymphomaSome factors may increase the risk of cancer for people with DM. These include:being 45 years and older at DM diagnosis being assigned male at birthexperiencing severe DM symptomshaving trouble swallowing as a DM symptomhaving anti-TIF1-gamma antibodieshaving DM that’s resistant to standard treatmentsHow does dermatomyositis affect treatment for small cell lung cancer?DM itself is often treated with corticosteroids. These are drugs that reduce the level of inflammation in the body.If necessary, other immunosuppressants like methotrexate and azathioprine may also be used for DM. These types of immunosuppressants broadly dampen the immune response.In situations where DM and SCLC occur together, DM may be treated briefly first. Then cancer treatment for SCLC is started, which typically includes one or a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.A 2022 case study also found that chemotherapy with the immunotherapy drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq) may be beneficial for DM-associated SCLC with anti-TIF1-gamma antibodies. After treatment, symptoms improved and tumor size decreased.How does dermatomyositis affect the outlook of those with small cell lung cancer?The outlook for DM and cancer is generally poor. A 2019 study notes that lung cancer signs in people with DM may be nonspecific and overlooked. Due to this, cancer may be diagnosed at more advanced stages when it has spread and is more difficult to treat.A 2020 study notes that previous research has found that the 5-year survival rate of people with DM is between 60% and 90%. When DM is associated with cancer, this falls to between 10% and 56%.Because DM and cancer can be closely linked, treating the cancer can reduce DM symptoms in some situations. For example, a 2021 case study reports resolution of DM symptoms after chemotherapy and radiation treatment for SCLC.However, even if DM symptoms resolve, it doesn’t mean that the cancer will go away as well. SCLC is often more aggressive than other types of lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the 5-year survival rates are:29% for SCLC that remains localized to the lung18% for SCLC that’s spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes3% for SCLC that’s spread to more distant tissues (metastasized)7% overallBesides the type of cancer and health conditions like DM, other factors are important for outlook as well, such as the cancer’s stage, grade, and your age. Your care team can provide you with a better estimate of your individual outlook.TakeawayDermatomyositis (DM) is a condition that happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks your muscles and skin. It’s also associated with an increased risk of cancer, including lung cancers like SCLC.The exact connection between DM and cancers like SCLC is unknown. However, it’s possible that a dysfunctional immune response to cancerous changes contributes to the link between the two conditions.Overall, the outlook for SCLC and DM is poor. However, it’s important to talk with your healthcare team regarding individual treatment recommendations and outlook.",https://www.healthline.com/health/lung-cancer/dermatomyositis-small-cell-lung-cancer,Dermatomyositis,Dermatomyositis and Small Cell Lung Cancer
81," What is rheumatic fever?Rheumatic fever is one of the complications associated with strep throat. It’s a relatively serious illness that usually appears in children between the ages of 5 and 15. However, older children and adults have been known to contract the illness as well. It’s still common in places such as sub-Saharan Africa, south central Asia, and among certain populations in Australia and New Zealand. It’s rare in the United States. What causes rheumatic fever?Rheumatic fever is caused by a bacterium called group A Streptococcus. This bacterium causes strep throat or, in a small percentage of people, scarlet fever. It’s an inflammatory disorder.Rheumatic fever causes the body to attack its own tissues. This reaction causes widespread inflammation throughout the body, which is the basis for all symptoms of rheumatic fever. What are the symptoms of rheumatic fever?Share on PinterestRheumatic fever is caused by a reaction to the bacterium that causes strep throat. Although not all cases of strep throat result in rheumatic fever, this serious complication may be prevented with a doctor’s diagnosis and treatment of strep throat. If your or your child have a sore throat along with any of the following symptoms, see your doctor for an evaluation:tender and swollen lymph nodesred rashdifficulty swallowingthick, bloody discharge from nosetemperature of 101°F (38.3°C) or abovetonsils that are red and swollen tonsils with white patches or pussmall, red spots on the roof of the mouthheadachenauseavomitingA wide variety of symptoms are associated with rheumatic fever. A person with the illness could experience a few, some, or most of the following symptoms. Symptoms usually appear two to four weeks after your child has a strep infection. Common symptoms of rheumatic fever include:small, painless nodules under the skin chest painrapid fluttering or pounding chest palpitationslethargy or fatiguenosebleedsstomach painpainful or sore joints in the wrists, elbows, knees, and anklespain in one joint that moves to another jointred, hot, swollen jointsshortness of breathfeversweatingvomitinga flat, slightly raised, ragged rashjerky, uncontrollable movements of the hands, feet, and face a decrease in attention spanoutbursts of crying or inappropriate laughterIf your child has a fever, they might require immediate care. Seek immediate medical care for your child in the following situations: For newborns to 6-week-old infants: more than a 100°F (37.8°C) temperatureFor babies 6 weeks to 6 months old: a 101°F (38.3°C) or higher temperatureFor a child of any age: a fever that lasts more than three daysRead more about fevers in babies. How is rheumatic fever diagnosed?Your child’s doctor will first want to get a list of your child’s symptoms and their medical history. They’ll also want to know if your child has had a recent bout of strep throat. Next, a physical exam will be given. Your child’s doctor will do the following, among other things: Look for a rash or skin nodules. Listen to their heart to check for abnormalities.Perform movement tests to determine their nervous system dysfunction.Examine their joints for inflammation.Test their throat and sometimes blood for evidence of strep bacteria.Perform an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which measures the electric waves of their heart.Perform an echocardiogram, which uses sound waves to produce images of their heart. If you need help finding a pediatrician, you can browse doctors in your area through the Healthline FindCare tool. What treatments are effective against rheumatic fever?Treatment will involve getting rid of all of the residual group A strep bacteria and treating and controlling the symptoms. This can include any of the following:AntibioticsYour child’s doctor will prescribe antibiotics and might prescribe a long-term treatment to prevent it from occurring again. In rare cases, your child may receive lifelong antibiotic treatment.Anti-inflammatory treatmentAnti-inflammatory treatments include pain medications that are also anti-inflammatory, such as aspirin (Bayer) or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). Though aspirin use in children with certain illnesses has been associated with Reye’s Syndrome, the benefits of using it in treating rheumatic fever may outweigh the risks. Doctors may also prescribe a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation.Anticonvulsant medicationsYour child’s doctor might prescribe an anticonvulsant if involuntary movements become too severe.Bed restYour child’s doctor will also recommend bed rest and restricted activities until the major symptoms — such as pain and inflammation — have passed. Strict bed rest will be recommended for a few weeks to a few months if the fever has caused heart problems. What are the risk factors for rheumatic fever?Factors that increase your child’s chances of developing rheumatic fever include:Family history. Certain genes make you more likely to develop rheumatic fever.Type of strep bacteria present. Certain strains are more likely than others to lead to rheumatic fever. Environmental factors present in developing countries, such as overcrowding. How is rheumatic fever prevented?The most effective way to make sure your child doesn’t develop rheumatic fever is to start treating their strep throat infection within several days and to treat it thoroughly. This means ensuring your child completes all prescribed doses of medication. Practicing proper hygiene methods can help prevent strep throat:Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing.Wash your hands.Avoid contact with people who are sick.Avoid sharing personal items with people who are sick. What complications are associated with rheumatic fever?Once they develop, the symptoms of rheumatic fever can last for months or even years. Rheumatic fever can cause long-term complications in certain situations. One of the most prevalent complications is rheumatic heart disease. Other heart conditions include:Aortic valve stenosis. This is a narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart.Aortic regurgitation. This is a leak in the aortic valve that causes blood to flow in the wrong direction.Heart muscle damage. This is inflammation that can weaken the heart muscle and decrease the heart’s ability to pump blood effectively.Atrial fibrillation. This is an irregular heartbeat in the upper chambers of the heart.Heart failure. This occurs when the heart can no longer pump blood to all parts of the body. If left untreated, rheumatic fever can lead to: strokepermanent damage to your heartdeath What’s the outlook for people with rheumatic fever?The long-term effects of rheumatic fever can be disabling if your child has a severe case. Some of the damage caused by the illness might not show up until years later. Be aware of long-term effects as your child grows older. If your child does experience long-term damage related to rheumatic fever, there are support services available to help them and your family.",https://www.healthline.com/health/rheumatic-fever,Rheumatic Fever,HealthLine: Rheumatic Fever
82," What is arthritis?Arthritis is a condition characterized by stiffness and inflammation, or swelling, of the joints. It’s not one type of disease, but it’s a general way of referring to joint pain or joint diseases. An estimated 52.5 million American adults have some type of arthritis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That’s a little over one in five Americans. While you may only experience mild discomfort at the beginning of the condition, symptoms can worsen over time. They may eventually cause work limitations and affect your day to day. While your risk for arthritis can increase with age, it’s not limited to older adults. Furthermore, there are different risk factors associated with different types of arthritis. Understanding the causes and risk factors of arthritis can help you and your doctor take preventive measures. This can help keep your symptoms from worsening or delay the onset of the condition. What causes arthritis?While there are many different types of arthritis, the two major categories are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Each of these arthritis types have different causes. Wear and tearOA is most commonly the result of wear-and-tear to the joints. Use of the joints over time can contribute to the breakdown of protective cartilage in your joints. This causes bone to rub against bone. That feeling can be very painful and restrict movement.InflammatoryRA is when the body’s immune system attacks itself. Specifically the body attacks the membrane that surrounds the joint parts. This can result in inflamed or swollen joints, destruction of cartilage and bone, and ultimately pain. You may also experience other symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and loss of appetite.InfectionSometimes, traumatic injury or an infection in the joints can advance the progression of arthritis. For example, reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that can follow some infections. This includes sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia, fungal infections, and food-borne illnesses.MetabolicWhen the body breaks down purines, a substance found in cells and foods, it forms uric acid. Some people have high levels of uric acid. When the body can’t get rid of it, the acid builds up and forms needle-like crystals in the joints. This causes extreme and sudden joint point, or a gout attack. Gout comes and goes, but if left untreated it can become chronic.Other causesOther skin and organ conditions can also cause arthritis. These include:psoriasis, a skin disease caused by excessive skin cell turnoverSjogren’s, a disorder that can cause decreased saliva and tears, and systemic diseaseinflammatory bowel disease, or conditions that include inflammation of the digestive tract such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis What increases your risk for arthritis?Sometimes arthritis can occur with no known cause. But there are also factors that can increase your risk for all types of arthritis. Age: Advanced age increases a person’s risk for arthritis types such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. Family history: You are more likely to have arthritis if your parent or sibling has an arthritis type. Gender: Women are more likely to have RA than men while men are more likely to have gout. Obesity: Excess weight can increase a person’s risk for OA because it puts more pressure on the joints. History of previous injuries: Those who have injured a joint from playing sports, from a car accident, or other occurrences are more likely to experience arthritis later.Even if you don’t feel the symptoms, you should discuss your potential risks for arthritis with your doctor. They can help provide ways to prevent or delay arthritis. What are the types of arthritis?Just as the location of arthritis varies, not all people will have the same type of arthritis. OsteoarthritisOA is the most common type of arthritis. The greatest risk factor for this condition is age. Normal pain and stiffness associated with getting older doesn’t go away when you have this condition. Previous injuries in childhood and young adulthood can also cause osteoarthritis, even if you think you fully recovered.Rheumatoid arthritisRA is the second most common type of arthritis. In people younger than 16 years old, it’s called juvenile inflammatory arthritis (previously it was known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). This type of autoimmune disease causes the body to attacks tissues in the joints. You have a greater risk of getting this form of arthritis if you already have another type of autoimmune disorder, such as lupus, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or multiple sclerosis. Pain and visible swelling, especially in the hands, characterize this condition. GoutGout is the third most common type of arthritis. When uric acid builds up, it crystalizes around the joints. This crystallization triggers inflammation, making it difficult and painful for bones to move. The Arthritis Foundation estimates that four percent of American adults develop gout, primarily in their middle ages. Obesity-related conditions can also increase your risk for high uric acid and gout. Signs of gout commonly start in the toes, but can occur in other joints in the body. Can you prevent arthritis?There is no single preventative measure for arthritis, especially considering all of the different forms that exist. But you can take steps to preserve joint function and mobility. These steps will also improve your overall quality of life. Learning more about the disease can also help with early treatment. For example, if you know you have an autoimmune disorder, you can be mindful of early symptoms. The earlier you catch the disease and start treatment the better you may be able to delay the progression of the disease.Some general recommendations as to how you can prevent arthritis include:Eating a Mediterranean-style diet. A diet of fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil, beans, and whole grains may help with inflammation. Decreasing your intake of sugar, wheat, and gluten may also help.Eating a diet low in sugars. Sugars can contribute to inflammation and gout pain. Maintaining a healthy weight. This reduces the demands on your joints. Exercising regularly. Physical activity can help reduce pain, improve mood, and increase joint mobility and function.Refraining from smoking. The habit can worsen autoimmune disorders, and is a major risk-factor for rheumatoid arthritisSeeing your doctor for yearly check-ups. Remember to report any symptoms that may be related to arthritis. Wearing proper protective equipment. When playing sports or doing work, protective equipment can help prevent injuries.  When should you see a doctor?Advanced arthritis can make mobility difficult, including the ability to perform everyday activities. Ideally, you would see your physician before your condition is in the advanced stages. That’s why it’s important to know about this condition, especially if you’re at risk for it. Some general recommendations for when to see your physician include:difficulty moving a particular joint joint swellingpainrednesswarmth at the affected joint Your doctor will listen to your symptoms and evaluate your medical and family history. A doctor may order further testing, such as blood, urine, joint fluid tests, or imaging studies (x-rays or ultrasound). These tests can help determine what type of arthritis you have. Your doctor may also use imaging tests to identify areas of injury or joint breakdown. Imaging tests include X-rays, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging scans. This can also help rule out other conditions. What are the treatments for arthritis?Your doctor may prescribe medication, recommend surgery, and encourage you to do physical therapy. At home you can ease arthritis pain by taking a warm shower, doing gentle stretching exercises, and using an ice pack on the sore area.Osteoarthritis treatmentYour doctor may initially treat OA with conservative methods. These include topical or oral over-the-counter pain relievers, or icing or warming the affected joint. You may also be encouraged to engage in physical therapy exercises to strengthen the muscles around the joint. If your osteoarthritis continues to advance, surgery may be recommended to repair or replace the joint. Joint replacement procedures are more common for large joints, such as the knees and hips. How to treat OA »Rheumatoid arthritis treatmentDoctors treat rheumatoid arthritis with medications that stop your immune system from attacking the joints. Other goals of treatment include relieving symptoms, preventing further damage and improve your overall being. Examples of these medications include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and DMARDs. In serious cases of RA, your doctor may recommend surgery.Read more: The anti-inflammatory diet for RA »Gout treatmentDoctors treat gout by recommending a low sugar, purine, and alcohol-free diet.

83,"Arthritis is an inflammation of the joints that may affect one joint or multiple joints. The symptoms of arthritis usually develop over time, but they may also appear suddenly.There are more than 100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in the United States. Other common types include:rheumatoid arthritis (RA) psoriatic arthritis (PsA)goutThe typical age for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is between ages 30 and 50. It can, however, affect children, teens, and younger adults. Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly develops after the age 50 or 60 years, but there are studies that reveal radiographic evidence of OA occurring in women in their 40s. It also tends to be more prevalent in individuals who are overweight.What are the symptoms of arthritis?Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling are the most common symptoms of arthritis. Your symptoms may also feel worse in the morning when you get out of bed or upon standing up after you’ve been resting.Other symptoms of osteoarthritis include:limited range of motion that sometimes goes away after movementclicking or popping with bendingmuscle weakness around the jointinstability or buckling of the jointbony growths in the fingersgrating or scraping feeling in the kneesOther symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include:morning stiffness that can last 30 minutes or moremore than one affected jointonset in smaller joints like feet and handssame joints on both sides of the body are affectedfatiguelow-grade feverinflammation of the eyes and mouthinflammation of the heart muscle and blood vesselslow red blood cell countWhat causes arthritis?Arthritis may be caused by:wear and tear of a joint from overuseage (OA is most common in adults over age 50)injuriesobesityautoimmune disordersgenes or family historymuscle weaknessOsteoarthritisNormal wear and tear causes OA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue. Cartilage is a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue causes some forms of arthritis.Your risk of developing OA may also be higher if you have a family history of the disease.Rheumatoid arthritisAnother common form of arthritis, RA, is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body’s immune system attacks the tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation to joints as well as other body organs. In the joints, this inflammatory response affects the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints, eventually destroying both bone and cartilage inside the joint.The exact cause of the immune system’s attacks is unknown. But scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk of developing RA fivefold.How is arthritis diagnosed?Seeing your primary care physician is a good first step if you’re unsure who to see for an arthritis diagnosis. They will perform a physical exam to check for fluid around the joints, warm or red joints, and document the range of motion in the joints. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist if needed.If you’re experiencing severe symptoms, you may choose to schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist first. This may lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment. Documenting inflammation levels in your blood and aspirating and analyzing joint fluids, if present, can help your doctor determine what kind of arthritis you have. Blood tests that check for specific types of antibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibody (ANA) are also common diagnostic tests.Doctors commonly use imaging scans such as X-ray, MRI, and CT scans to produce an image of your bones and cartilage. This helps them rule out other causes of your symptoms, such as bone spurs.How is arthritis treated?The main goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of pain you’re experiencing and prevent additional damage to the joints. You’ll learn what works best for you in terms of managing pain. In general, treatment for arthritis involves a combination of:medications and supplementsphysical therapyoccupational therapynutrient-rich dietregular exerciseweight loss, if neededheat and cold compressesmobility assistance devices, such as canes or walkersImproving your joint function is also important. Your doctor may prescribe a combination of treatment methods to achieve the best results.MedicationsA number of different types of medication treat arthritis:Analgesics, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are effective for pain management, but do not help decrease inflammation.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil) and salicylates, help manage pain and inflammation. Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should not be used with additional blood thinning medications.Menthol or capsaicin creams. These creams block the transmission of pain signals from your joints.Steroids, like prednisone, help reduce inflammation but should be used cautiously and for brief periods of time.Immunosuppressants and biologics. Immunosuppressants and biologics are prescribed for moderate to severe inflammatory arthritis like RA.If you have RA, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system. DMARDs and biologics are being prescribed earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate is now a first-line drug for treatment. There are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription.SupplementsWhile clinical evidence and safety data are lacking for many herbs and supplements marketed for arthritis, there are a few supplements that may be beneficial. For example, avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) may help OA symptoms. Fish oil and turmeric supplements may help reduce inflammation in RA. However, you should talk with your doctor before taking any supplements for arthritis to make sure they are safe for you and will not interact with any medications you’re currently taking.SurgerySurgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replace hips and knees. If your arthritis is most severe in your fingers or wrists, your doctor may perform joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are fused, eliminating the joint and therefore eliminating the site of inflammation.Physical therapyPhysical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment. Outside of your appointments, your physical therapist will likely recommend a plan of care that includes daily movement along with exercises you can complete on your own at home. Collectively, these can help build strength, flexibility, and balance to improve mobility while also preventing falls.What lifestyle changes can help people with arthritis?Losing any excess weight and maintaining a moderate weight reduces the risk of developing OA and can reduce symptoms if you already have the condition. Eating a nutrient-dense diet is important for weight loss. Choosing a diet with lots of antioxidants, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, can help reduce inflammation. Other inflammation-reducing foods include fish and nuts. Foods that should be limited or avoided if you have arthritis include:fried foods processed foods dairy products a high intake of meatSome research also suggests that gluten antibodies may be present in people with RA. A gluten-free diet may improve symptoms and disease progression. A 2015 study also recommends a gluten-free diet for all people who receive a diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease.Regular exercise can keep your joints flexible. Swimming is often a good form of exercise for people with arthritis because it does not put pressure on your joints the way running and walking do. Staying active is important, but listening to your body when it’s signally resting and avoiding overexerting yourself are just as essential. At-home exercises you can try include:the head tilt, neck rotation, and other exercises to relieve pain in your neckfinger bends and thumb bends to ease pain in your handsleg raises, hamstring stretches, and other easy exercises for knee arthritisComplicationsWhen left untreated, symptoms of arthritis may worsen and affect your day-to-day life. Below are some of the possible complications associated with this condition:Reduced mobility. As arthritis progresses, you may experience less comfortable movement. This can interfere with your daily routine and may keep you from your favorite activities as well as socializing. Possible weight gain. This is attributed to decreased movements, as well as discomfort that keeps you from exercising. Increased risk of metabolic disorders. Being overweight with an inflammatory condition like arthritis may increase your chances of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease. Inflammation in other areas of your body. If your arthritis is attributed to an autoimmune disease like with RA, the inflammation can spread and affect your skin, eyes, blood vessels, and lungs. Risk of falls. According to the Arthritis Foundation, people with OA are more likely to experience falls and possible fractures. This is primarily caused by related muscle weakness, but dizziness from pain medications can also lead to falls.Decreased ability to work. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about 60 percent of people with arthritis are working age. Arthritis may affect your ability to move around in the workplace or even get from your mode of transportation to your job site. Effects on mental health. Arthritis may increase the risk of anxiety and depression due to ongoing pain, inflammation, and social isolation. Risk factorsThe overall risk factors for arthritis include:Obesity. Particularly associated with OA, being overweight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints in the body, such as your knees and hips. Losing excess weight can help reduce your risk of developing arthritis, and it may also help if you already have the condition.Age and gender. The risk of developing arthritis increases with age. Also, women are more likely than men to develop most forms of arthritis. The exception is gout, which is more prominent in men.Overuse injuries. Repetitive stress injuries incurred during exercise, your job, or other activities may increase your risk of developing OA in the affected joint(s) later in life.Your genes. A family history of autoimmune diseases as well as certain inherited genes may increase your risk of RA and other related types of arthritis.Smoking. Your risk of developing RA may increase if you smoke, and smoking can in turn make this autoimmune disease worse. What is the long-term outlook for people with arthritis?While there’s no cure for arthritis, the right treatment can greatly reduce your symptoms. In addition to the treatments your doctor recommends, you can make a number of lifestyle changes that may also help you manage your arthritis.",https://www.healthline.com/health/arthritis,Arthritis,HealthLine: Arthritis
84,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 23% of adults in the United States have arthritis (1).If you’re among the many people living with this condition, you may wonder whether there are any changes you can make to help alleviate some of the symptoms and improve your overall quality of life.Fortunately, some evidence indicates that dietary changes can help manage the symptoms of arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (2, 3, 4).This article explores whether eating eggs affects the symptoms of arthritis.Share on PinterestCavan Images/Getty ImagesWhat is arthritis?Arthritis is a common condition that can cause inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and pain in various joints in the body. While there are more than 100 different types of arthritis, osteoarthritis and RA are the most common (5).Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition in which the cartilage in your joints changes over time, leading to pain and reduced mobility. RA is an autoimmune condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy joint cells (6, 7).The causes of arthritis vary depending on the type. For example, osteoarthritis can be caused by aging, joint trauma, and obesity, while RA is caused by genetic and environmental factors (5, 8).According to the CDC, 8 million adults with arthritis feel that their ability to perform at work is negatively affected by the disease. To manage the symptoms, the CDC recommends staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, and discussing treatment options with your doctor (1).Some doctors recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other prescription medications. Many people also find relief with massage, acupuncture, or cold and heat therapies.Lastly, eating a diet high in antioxidants and low in inflammatory foods may also help relieve symptoms (5).SummaryThere are over 100 different types of arthritis, with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) being the most common. Some evidence suggests that dietary changes could help alleviate arthritis symptoms.Can eggs make arthritis symptoms worse?Whether eggs can worsen arthritis symptoms may depend on allergies or intolerances.Eggs and inflammationThe arachidonic acid found in egg yolks can contribute to inflammation in the body. However, there’s currently no evidence to suggest that eliminating eggs from your diet will prevent arthritis development or improve its symptoms (9).On the contrary, eggs have been shown to contain compounds that may have anti-inflammatory properties. For this reason, eating two eggs per week as a part of a well-balanced diet is recommended for most adults, including those with arthritis (9).A study in 150 people, 50 of whom had RA, found that a Western diet high in refined grains, red meat, and processed food increased the risk of the condition, while a balanced diet including whole grains, eggs, fruits, and vegetables decreased the risk (10).For years, eating eggs has been controversial, as they have both anti- and pro-inflammatory properties. Since arthritis involves joint inflammation, some people believe that eliminating foods with pro-inflammatory properties, such as eggs, may alleviate the symptoms (11).Additionally, eggs contain cholesterol, a type of fat that can promote inflammation in the body. However, this is typically only seen in individuals with insulin resistance or other metabolic conditions (12).Overall, specific research on eggs’ effects on inflammation and arthritis symptoms is limited.Vegan and elimination dietsOne review found that a vegan diet, which is free from eggs, improved arthritis symptoms. Another review observed positive effects of vegan, elemental, elimination, and Mediterranean diets among those with RA (13, 14).Note that while a vegan diet doesn’t contain eggs, the other mentioned diet types might. Thus, this research is inconclusive when it comes to eggs’ effects on arthritis symptoms (14).If a person has an egg intolerance or allergy, research shows that they’ll likely experience an improvement in their arthritis symptoms by eliminating them from their diet (14).However, if you don’t have an egg allergy or intolerance, there’s currently no research indicating a need to eliminate this nutritious food from your diet. If you’re worried that eggs are contributing to your arthritis symptoms, you can always try cutting them out for a few weeks to months to see whether you notice any improvements.SummaryThose with an egg allergy or intolerance may experience less inflammation and improved arthritis symptoms if they stop eating eggs. However, no specific research indicates that eating eggs will worsen your symptoms if you don’t have an egg allergy.Health benefits of eggsEggs are nutrient-dense and offer several health benefits when enjoyed as a part of a well-balanced diet.Nutrient-denseEggs are full of nutrients, including protein, vitamin D, choline, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and antioxidants (15).One egg yolk contains 37 IU of vitamin D, which is 5% of the Daily Value (DV) (15). Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to RA, and early research indicates that the vitamin may help relieve symptoms of the condition if used as a supplement. If possible, buy eggs from pasture-raised chickens, as these eggs tend to contain more vitamin D (16, 17).Eggs also contain choline, a nutrient that plays an important role in brain health and may help protect against age-related memory decline (18).Lastly, the protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants from eggs all have several health benefits that are outlined below.May improve eye healthEggs contain lutein and zeaxanthin, which are powerful antioxidants. Concentrated amounts of them are also found in the retina, which is the innermost part of your eye (19).These antioxidants are often referred to as macular pigments because they’ve been shown to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration, an eye condition that affects the retina and can cause blurry vision or vision loss (19, 20). What’s more, lutein and zeaxanthin are speculated to prevent other eye conditions like diabetic retinopathy and cataracts (19, 20).May support weight managementRegularly eating eggs may help you manage your weight. Weight management is one of the CDC’s recommendations for managing arthritis symptoms (1).Despite providing only around 70 calories each, eggs are filling. This is thanks to their protein content, a macronutrient that has been shown to help keep you full, especially when eaten with a healthy source of fiber like whole grains or vegetables (15, 21, 22).Additionally, eating protein can boost your metabolism due to its high thermic effect, which is how much energy your body needs to digest and absorb food. Research shows that proteins often have a higher thermic effect than carbs and fats (23, 24).SummaryEggs are nutrient-dense and boast several health benefits. For example, they support weight management, improve eye health, and reduce heart disease risk.The bottom lineArthritis is a condition that can cause painful inflammation in the joints. It affects almost 1 in 4 adults in the United States (1, 5).Those with an allergy or sensitivity to eggs tend to have an inflammatory response when consuming them, which can worsen their arthritis symptoms.If you have arthritis and no known intolerance to eggs, there’s no need to avoid eating them regularly as a part of a well-balanced diet. They’re nutrient-dense and may help you manage your weight and reduce your risk of heart and eye diseases.Just one thingTry this today: Make a nutrient-dense, anti-inflammatory breakfast. First, sauté chopped spinach with olive oil in a skillet or frying pan. Next, crack one or a few eggs on top, reduce the heat to low, and cover. Let the dish cook until the egg whites are cooked through and the yolk is cooked to your preferred consistency. Serve with a side of fresh fruit for an extra boost of antioxidants.",https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/eggs-and-rheumatoid-arthritis,Arthritis,Does Eating Eggs Affect Arthritis Symptoms?
85," About rheumatoid arthritisRheumatoid arthritis (RA) occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. This affects the lining of the joints in the body and causes pain in different body parts.While RA commonly impacts the hands and feet, larger joints such as the elbows and knees may also be affected. RA can produce a variety of other symptoms, including joint stiffness and difficulty breathing. Read on to see what people who have RA say about living with this condition. What does RA feel like?Pain in the jointsRA usually appears gradually, affecting small joints first and then spreading to larger joints. In most cases, the pain occurs on both sides of the body.Symmetric pain in multiple joints is what makes RA different from other types of arthritis. For example, you’ll feel pain in both left and right wrists, hands, and knees.If you have RA, joint pain can range from mild to moderate or severe. Sometimes it can feel like a sprain or broken bone. Some areas of your body may even be painful to the touch.Stiffness in the jointsIn addition to pain, this disease causes stiffness in the affected joints. You may have difficulty getting out of bed or walking in the morning because of stiff and painful ankles, knees, or feet. This stiffness is usually worse in the mornings and can last for 45 minutes or more.RA can also trigger swelling in the affected joints. Long-term inflammation can cause you to feel physically exhausted.Low energyRA can result in low energy, especially when the pain gets in the way of sleeping. Even when you do get enough sleep, you may still feel tired, or fatigued.About 80 percent of people with RA say they feel fatigue. This number can increase if you have other conditions, such as obesity, depression, and headaches. You may feel tired or unwell earlier in the day.Difficulty breathingJoint pain is the most common symptom of RA, but it’s not the only one. RA can also affect your lungs. This is because long-term inflammation can cause scarring in your lungs, which causes shortness of breath and a chronic dry cough.Some people with RA develop lung nodules or abnormal lung tissue (due to inflammation), which can be visualized on X-rays. The nodules are often benign and they can range in size from as small as a pea to as large as a walnut. Generally, they don’t cause pain.Itchy skinIf RA affects your skin, you may develop nodules or lumps of tissue underneath the skin. You may also develop a rash due to inflammation around or in the blood vessels.RA may also cause eye-related problems. Symptoms of eye inflammation include:dry eyespainrednesslight sensitivityblurry vision Complications and outlook for RALong-term inflammation can also affect other organs. Nearly 40 percent of people with RA also experience symptoms in other parts of the body, according to the Mayo Clinic. These parts include the:eyesskinheartliverkidneysnervous systemRA can increase your risk for other diseases or complications. These may cause other symptoms that appear unrelated to RA, such as hearing loss or irregular heartbeats.RA is a chronic condition that, if left untreated, could possibly result in deformed and knotted-looking joints. Small lumps, known as rheumatoid nodules, can develop under the skin at pressure points or other areas like the back of the scalp. RA also increases the risk of other conditions, such as:infectionslymphomalung diseaseheart problemsperipheral neuropathyAlthough RA affects people differently, the outlook is generally good — as long as you seek treatment. Treatment may not alleviate 100 percent of swelling and flare-ups, but it can reduce the severity of symptoms and help you enjoy periods of remission. Treatment for RAThere’s currently no cure for RA, but many treatments can help control symptoms, limit joint damage, and facilitate a clinical remission.The earlier your doctor diagnoses RA, the more effective your treatment is. Current treatments help most people with RA continue a healthy, active, and functioning lifestyle.MedicationIn cases of mild RA, over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers or nonsteroidal drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may provide relief. Your doctor will likely prescribe disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to prevent disease progression.DMARDs can help reduce inflammation and therefore decrease swelling and pain. For more severe inflammation and pain, you may need biologic response modifiers. These medications target specific parts of the immune system and help decrease inflammation and prevent joint and tissue damage.SurgeryYour doctor may recommend surgery if medications don’t help. During the surgical procedures, your doctor can remove inflamed lining of joints or repair tendon damage. Joint fusion helps stabilize damaged joints and relieve pain. In some cases, your doctor may recommend total joint replacement and replace damaged joints with a prosthetic.ExerciseResearch shows that exercises that incorporate flexibility and strengthening can help relieve pain and improve daily functioning. Moderate exercises like walking, swimming, and yoga can help strengthen your joints. Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity at least three times a week.Occupational and physical therapists can help you learn exercises to maintain flexibility in your joints and provide strategies to make daily tasks easier and protect your joints.Alternative treatmentsAlternative therapies don’t aim to cure RA but instead aim to relieve symptoms of pain, fatigue, and more. For example, fish oil supplements can help reduce inflammation. Adding other supplements may also benefit. These supplements include:black currant oilborage oilbromelaincat’s clawcapsaicinflax seedgingkoA lot of research has gone into herbs and supplements for RA, but talk to your doctor before taking any of them. They may interact with medications you’re already taking and cause unintended side effects. When to see a doctorCall your doctor if you have discomfort or swelling in your joints. Your doctor will take a complete history and examine you for signs and symptoms of an inflammatory arthritis such as stiffness, swelling, tenderness, and pain. The doctor will also look for signs of infection.There’s no single test that determines whether you have RA. Your doctor may run several tests to help confirm a RA diagnosis. These tests include:checking your blood for specific antibodies such as rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodytaking samples of synovial fluid to look for inflammation or infectionlooking for inflammation (elevated erythrocytes sedimentation rate or C reactive protein)ordering imaging tests to look at your joints and bones or evidence of inflammation or joint damageSometimes, X-rays are ineffective in diagnosing the disease. An MRI or ultrasound can show abnormalities in your joints before X-ray changes appear.Don’t be afraid to get a second opinion if you’re still experiencing discomfort from your condition. A doctor can prescribe new medications if the ones you’re taking aren’t working.RA usually appears in people between the ages of 25 and 50. If you aren’t in this age range, you should still see a doctor if you think you’re experiencing symptoms of RA. In the case of RA, the earlier you receive your treatment, the better your outcome is. Find ways to cope and supportTalk to those close to you about your condition. The more they know about what it’s like to have RA, the more they can help.You can also join Healthline’s Facebook community Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis and share your story or ask for advice. Joining a support group is a good way to learn more about the disease, coping methods, and new treatments.You can also find local support groups through Arthritis Introspective or the Arthritis Foundation.“Having RA can be so frustrating. Between the swelling and the stiffness, at any given time lifting a laundry basket full of towels can be excruciating, and the simple little things we once could do are torture.”  – April B., living with RA“I usually ask people if they remember wiping out on their bicycles when they were kids and getting a huge road rash all up their leg. The pain and stiffness that would follow is pretty much how it feels in my joints.”– Jill R-D., living with RA“Surprising how quick it came on. Overnight I was suffering from pain and stiffness in my hands, and over a week it spread through my body and finally to my feet. I couldn’t wear most shoes, and when I walked it was like walking on stones. Thanks to meds the pain is now under control and I can walk again. But the fatigue never leaves and I’ve had to drop hours at work.” – Jo H., living with RA“The emotional feelings are harder to describe. I’ve gone from a productive, active, working wife, mother, and grandmother, to a low-energy, dependent person on an emotional roller coaster. The worst physical pain is in my hands and wrists. It keeps me from doing things I once enjoyed like cooking and crafting. The most difficult adjustments I’ve had that affect my emotions are not being able to work, give and receive big hugs, hold my grandbabies for very long, and play with and walk my two dogs. I’m surrounded by a loving family, and my husband has been my rock as we learn to ride the waves of this disease together.” – Ruth D., living with RA",https://www.healthline.com/health/what-does-rheuamtoid-arthritis-feel,Rheumatoid Arthritis,How Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Make You Feel?
86,"Erythromelalgia is a rare skin condition that affects the feet, hands, arms, and legs. Symptoms include episodes of redness, burning, and pain in the areas affected. Some people with erythromelalgia experience mild tingling pain, while others experience severe burning pain. Erythromelalgia episodes are called flare-ups. They occur when your body is exposed to certain triggers.Anyone at any age can get erythromelalgia, although people assigned female at birth seem to be more prone to the condition than people assigned male. Treatment for erythromelalgia depends on the severity, cause, and progression of the condition. In this article, we take a closer look at erythromelalgia — its symptoms, causes, triggers, and treatment.What does erythromelalgia look like?Erythromelalgia causes red and painful skin. A flare-up will generally appear brighter red against light skin tones and darker red against dark skin tones. This image gallery shows what erythromelalgia looks like on different skin tones.What are the symptoms of erythromelalgia?The primary symptoms of erythromelalgia are redness, warmth, and pain on the skin of your feet, hands, arms, and legs. Occasionally, symptoms appear on the face and ears as well. Secondary symptoms of erythromelalgia include:swelling in the affected body partsskin that feels tendersweating more than normal in the affected body areassweating less than normal in the affected body areasdiscoloration of the skin even when there’s no flare-upSymptoms might be mild or severe. When symptoms are mild, you may be able to manage them without significant disruption to your daily life. When erythromelalgia symptoms are severe, the pain can make it difficult to walk or even sleep normally. What triggers an erythromelalgia flare-up?Generally, erythromelalgia flare-ups are caused by increases in your body temperature. This commonly occurs when:you’re dehydratedyou’re in a warm locationyou’re wearing very warm clothing, especially socks or glovesyou exerciseyou experience stressyou drink alcoholyou eat spicy foodWhat causes erythromelalgia?The exact causes of erythromelalgia aren’t always known. In most cases of erythromelalgia, no cause is pinpointed. But there are a few known causes. Erythromelalgia can be a side effect of certain medications, like:bromocriptinecalcium channel blockerscyclosporineiodinated contrast agentsnorephedrinetopical isopropanolrosuvastatinAdditionally, it can sometimes be the result of another medical condition. Conditions that may cause erythromelalgia include:multiple sclerosis (MS)peripheral neuropathy and other types of nerve damagelupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or another autoimmune conditionpolycythemia vera and conditions that impact your bloodGenetics can also play a role. According to an older 2007 review, a mutation on the SCN9A gene that causes erythromelalgia. This gene mutation can run in families and be passed from one generation to the next. How is erythromelalgia diagnosed?There are no specific tests to confirm a diagnosis of erythromelalgia. Generally, a diagnosis is made based on an examination of your skin, a review of your medical history, and a discussion of your symptoms with your doctor. In some cases, your erythromelalgia diagnosis will be made by a primary care doctor. In other cases, you might need to see a dermatologist. You might have a few tests to rule out other conditions or to support an erythromelalgia diagnosis. Tests could include:blood testsX-raysskin biopsiesHow is erythromelalgia treated?Generally, treatments for erythromelalgia include topical treatments, oral medications, IV medications, and at-home trigger management. Your erythromelalgia treatment plan will depend on your symptoms, the progression of your disease, and how you respond to initial treatments. Common treatments are discussed below. At-home trigger management. You might work with your doctor to develop a plan to avoid triggers and reduce flare-ups. This might include controlling the temperature in your home, avoiding certain foods, wearing lighter fabrics, and other lifestyle changes.At-home symptom management. You can manage the pain and redness of flare-ups by cooling the impacted body part. It can help to use fans, cold water, or ice packs for a short period. It’s important to do this carefully and avoid letting your skin get too cold or letting your skin heat back up too quickly. Topical treatments. You might be prescribed creams or gels to soothe your skin and reduce pain during a flare-up. This normally includes creams that are lidocaine- or capsaicin-based.Oral medications. There are a variety of oral medications that can help with erythromelalgia. This might include anti-inflammatory medications, nerve pain medications, aspirin, or antidepressants. Depending on the underlying cause of your erythromelalgia, beta-blockers or other blood pressure medications might also help reduce flare-ups. IV medications. Your doctor might recommend IV medication treatment if your erythromelalgia flare-ups are severe or aren’t controlled by topical or oral treatments. You’ll generally receive a single IV treatmentWhat’s the outlook for erythromelalgia? There isn’t a cure for erythromelalgia, and it’s generally a lifelong condition. But this isn’t always the case. If your erythromelalgia is caused by another condition, treating that condition might resolve it. Similarly, erythromelalgia caused by medication generally resolves when you stop taking that medication. Even when erythromelalgia isn’t caused by another condition or a medication, it sometimes resolves on its own. When erythromelalgia is chronic, management depends on finding the right treatment plan. It might take several tries to find the combination of treatments that works best for you. Even with treatment, erythromelalgia can sometimes be progressive and get worse over time. Your outlook will depend on your specific case.Where can you find support for erythromelalgia?A diagnosis of erythromelalgia can be stressful and overwhelming. It’s easy to feel alone when you have a diagnosis that your friends and family might not be familiar with. But you don’t need to face your condition alone. There are organizations you can turn to for information and support. The Erythromelalgia Association is a good place to start. It provides a resource library, member support network, physician guide, and more. TakeawayErythromelalgia is a rare condition that causes skin redness, warmth, and pain in certain areas of your body. The condition primarily affects your feet, legs, arms, and hands. Erythromelalgia flare-ups are triggered by exposure to rising temperatures, like when you exercise or are in very warm climates. The condition can occur on its own or be caused by another condition.

87,"            Erythromelalgia is a rare poorly understood clinical condition characterized by intense burning pain, pronounced erythema, and increased skin temperature. Although there are many classifications of the disease, it can basically be divided into primary, which begins spontaneously at any age, and secondary, which is associated with myeloproliferative disorders-related thrombocythemia, polycythemia, collagen-vascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy, autoimmune and infectious diseases, and use of certain medicaments. A wide variety of etiological conditions can cause erythromelalgia, all having a single common pathogenetic mechanism - microvascular arteriovenous shunting. The disease is characterized by severe pain associated with redness and hotness in extremities. The diagnosis is based on the medical history and clinical findings. The most useful oral medications for erythromelalgia seem to be aspirin, propranolol, clonazepam, cyproheptadine, drugs inhibiting serotonin re-uptake (venlafaxine and sertraline), tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine), anticonvulsants (gabapentin), calcium antagonists (nifedipine, diltiazem), and prostaglandins (micoprostol). Erythromelalgia is usually chronic, sometimes progressive, and disabling disease, which can greatly affect the quality of life. Some patients have stable disease and get better, or even experience full resolution of the disease, with time. This review article presents the etiological basis, diagnostics, and therapy of erythromelalgia.    ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15075045/,Erythromelalgia,Erythromelalgia
88,"DescriptionErythromelalgia is a condition characterized by episodes of pain, redness, and swelling in various parts of the body, particularly the hands and feet. These episodes are usually triggered by increased body temperature, which may be caused by exercise or entering a warm room. Ingesting alcohol or spicy foods may also trigger an episode. Wearing warm socks, tight shoes, or gloves can cause a pain episode so debilitating that it can impede everyday activities such as wearing shoes and walking. Pain episodes can prevent an affected person from going to school or work regularly.The signs and symptoms of erythromelalgia typically begin in childhood, although mildly affected individuals may have their first pain episode later in life. As individuals with erythromelalgia get older and the disease progresses, the hands and feet may be constantly red, and the affected areas can extend from the hands to the arms, shoulders, and face, and from the feet to the entire legs.Erythromelalgia is often considered a form of peripheral neuropathy because it affects the peripheral nervous system, which connects the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to cells that detect sensations such as touch, smell, and pain.FrequencyThe prevalence of erythromelalgia is unknown.CausesMutations in the SCN9A gene can cause erythromelalgia. The SCN9A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha subunit) of a sodium channel called NaV1.7. Sodium channels transport positively charged sodium atoms (sodium ions) into cells and play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. NaV1.7 sodium channels are found in  nerve cells called nociceptors that transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and brain.The SCN9A gene mutations that cause erythromelalgia result in NaV1.7 sodium channels that open more easily than usual and stays open longer than normal, increasing the flow of sodium ions into nociceptors. This increase in sodium ions  enhances transmission of pain signals, leading to the signs and symptoms of erythromelalgia. It is unknown why the pain episodes associated with erythromelalgia mainly occur in the hands and feet.An estimated 15 percent of cases of erythromelalgia are caused by mutations in the SCN9A gene. Other cases are thought to have a nongenetic cause or may be caused by mutations in one or more as-yet unidentified genes.Learn more about the gene associated with ErythromelalgiaSCN9AInheritanceSome cases of erythromelalgia occur in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.  In some of these instances, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.  Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.Other Names for This ConditionErythermalgia Familial erythromelalgia Primary erythromelalgiaAdditional Information & ResourcesGenetic Testing InformationGenetic Testing Registry: Primary erythromelalgia Genetic and Rare Diseases Information CenterErythromelalgia Patient Support and Advocacy ResourcesDisease InfoSearchNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)Research Studies from ClinicalTrials.govClinicalTrials.gov Catalog of Genes and Diseases from OMIMERYTHERMALGIA, PRIMARYScientific Articles on PubMedPubMed ReferencesCregg R, Laguda B, Werdehausen R, Cox JJ, Linley JE, Ramirez JD, Bodi I,Markiewicz M, Howell KJ, Chen YC, Agnew K, Houlden H, Lunn MP, Bennett DL, WoodJN, Kinali M.

89," What is myelofibrosis?Myelofibrosis (MF) is a type of bone marrow cancer that affects your body’s ability to produce blood cells. It’s part of a group of conditions called myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These conditions cause your bone marrow cells to stop developing and functioning the way they should, resulting in fibrous scar tissue. MF can be primary, meaning it occurs on its own, or secondary, meaning it results from another condition — usually one that affects your bone marrow. Other MPNs can also progress to MF. While some people can go years without having symptoms, others have symptoms that get worse due to scarring in their bone marrow.  What are the symptoms?Myelofibrosis tends to come on slowly, and many people don’t notice symptoms at first. However, as it progresses and starts to interfere with blood cell production, its symptoms may include: fatigueshortness of breathbruising or bleeding easily feeling pain or fullness on your left side, below your ribs night sweatsfeverbone painloss of appetite and weight lossnosebleeds or bleeding gums  What causes it?Myelofibrosis is associated with a genetic mutation in blood stem cells. However, researchers aren’t sure what causes this mutation. When the mutated cells replicate and divide, they pass the mutation on to new blood cells. Eventually, the mutated cells overtake the bone marrow’s ability to produce healthy blood cells. This usually results in too few red blood cells and too many white blood cells. It also causes scarring and hardening of your bone marrow, which is usually soft and spongy.  Are there any risk factors?Myelofibrosis is rare, occurring in only about 1.5 out of every 100,000 people in the United States. However, several things can increase your risk of developing it, including:Age. While people of any age can have myelofibrosis, it’s usually diagnosed in those over the age of 50. Another blood disorder. Some people with MF develop it as a complication of another condition, such as thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.Exposure to chemicals. MF has been associated with exposure to certain industrial chemicals, including toluene and benzene. Exposure to radiation. People who’ve been exposed to radioactive material may have an increased risk of developing MF.  How is it diagnosed?MF usually shows up on a routine complete blood count (CBC). People with MF tend to have very low levels of red blood cells and unusually high or low levels of white blood cells and platelets. Based on the results of your CBC test, your doctor might also do a bone marrow biopsy. This involves taking a small sample of your bone marrow and looking at it more closely for signs of MF, such as scarring. You may also need an X-ray or MRI scan to rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms or CBC results. How is it treated?MF treatment usually depends on the types of symptoms you have. Many common MF symptoms are associated with an underlying condition caused by MF, such as anemia or an enlarged spleen. Treating anemiaIf MF is causing severe anemia, you may need:Blood transfusions. Regular blood transfusions can increase your red blood cell count and reduce anemia symptoms, such as fatigue and weakness.Hormone therapy. A synthetic version of the male hormone androgen may promote red blood cell production in some people. Corticosteroids. These may be used with androgens to encourage red blood cell production or decrease their destruction. Prescription medications. Immunomodulatory medications, such as thalidomide (Thalomid), and lenalidomide (Revlimid), may improve blood cell counts. They may also help with symptoms of an enlarged spleen. Treating an enlarged spleenIf you have an enlarged spleen related to MF that’s causing problems, your doctor might recommend: Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses targeted beams to kill cells and reduce the size of the spleen. Chemotherapy. Some chemotherapy drugs may reduce the size of your enlarged spleen. Surgery. A splenectomy is a surgical procedure that removes your spleen. Your doctor might recommend this if you aren’t responding well to other treatments. Treating mutated genesA new drug called ruxolitinib (Jakafi) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 to treat the symptoms associated with MF. Ruxolitinib targets a specific genetic mutation that may be the cause of MF. In clinical trials, it was shown to reduce the size of enlarged spleens, reduce the symptoms of MF, and improve prognosis. Experimental treatmentsResearchers are working on developing new treatments for MF. While many of these require further study to make sure they’re safe, doctors have started using two new treatments in certain cases: Stem cell transplant. Stem cell transplants have the potential to cure MF and restore bone marrow function. However, the procedure can cause life-threatening complications, so it’s usually only done when nothing else works. Interferon-alpha. Interferon-alfa has delayed the formation of scar tissue in the bone marrow of people who receive treatment early on, but more research is needed to determine its long-term safety.  Are there any complications?Over time, myelofibrosis can lead to several complications, including:Increased blood pressure in your liver. Increased blood flow from an enlarged spleen can raise the pressure in the portal vein in your liver, causing a condition called portal hypertension. This can put too much pressure on smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus, which could lead to excessive bleeding or a ruptured vein. Tumors. Blood cells can form in clumps outside the bone marrow, causing tumors to grow in other areas of your body. Depending on where these tumors are located, they can cause a variety of different problems, including seizures, bleeding in the gastric tract, or compression of the spinal cord. Acute leukemia. About 15 to 20 percent of people with MF go on to develop acute myeloid leukemia, a serious and aggressive form of cancer.  Living with myelofibrosisWhile MF often doesn’t cause symptoms in its early stages, it can eventually lead to serious complications, including more aggressive types of cancer. Work with your doctor to determine the best course of treatment for you and how you can manage your symptoms. Living with MF can be stressful, so you may find it helpful to seek out support from an organization such as the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society or the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Research Foundation. Both organizations can help you find local support groups, online communities, and even financial resources for treatment.",https://www.healthline.com/health/myelofibrosis,Myelofibrosis,Understanding Myelofibrosis
90,"Share on PinterestMyelofibrosis (MF) is a disease that usually develops slowly over a long period of time. Not everyone experiences symptoms, and the most common symptoms are often related to other, more common diseases.Still, knowing the symptoms of MF can help you be more prepared and start on a treatment plan as early as possible.What are the symptoms of MF? In the early stages of MF, many people do not experience symptoms. However, as the disease progresses and normal blood cell production in the body becomes more disrupted, you may begin to experience symptoms. These can include:pale skineasy bruising or bleedingexcessive sweating while sleepingfeverfrequent infectionsfatigue, feeling weak, or feeling short of breath (usually caused by anemia)bone painpain or a feeling of fullness below your ribs, usually on the left side (caused by an enlarged spleen)When should you contact a doctor?If you’re experiencing any of these symptoms for an extended period of time, contact your doctor. They will perform a physical exam and possibly other tests, as well as discuss the symptoms you’ve been having. These other tests may include blood tests, imaging tests, and a bone marrow exam. If your primary doctor thinks you may have MF, they will most likely refer you to a hematologist, or doctor who specializes in blood and bone marrow disorders. What are the potential complications?As MF progresses, you may have more severe symptoms. As bone marrow continues to turn to scar tissue and blood cell production becomes more abnormal, you also may begin to experience more serious side effects or complications, such as:PainAn enlarged spleen can cause abdominal and back pain. This can be a symptom of MF. Joint pain can also be present in MF as bone marrow hardens and connective tissue around the joints becomes inflamed. GoutMF causes the body to produce more uric acid than normal. The increased uric acid can crystallize and settle around joints, causing pain and swelling.Increased pressure on blood flowing into your liverBlood flows from the spleen into the liver to be processed. An enlarged spleen will cause the amount of blood flowing into the liver, and also the blood pressure, to increase. This is called portal hypertension. The increased blood pressure can force extra blood into smaller veins in the digestive system, such as the esophagus or stomach. This could cause these smaller veins to rupture and bleed.BleedingAs MF progresses, your platelet count could drop below normal. A low number of platelets (thrombocytopenia) can lead to easy bleeding. If you’re considering a surgical procedure, this is an important complication for you and your doctor to consider.Formation of blood cells outside the bone marrowThis can lead to clumps or tumors of blood cells in other parts of the body, causing complications such as bleeding, nerve damage, or seizures.Acute leukemiaAbout 12 percent of people with MF will develop acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). AML is a quickly progressing cancer of the blood and bone marrow.The takeawayWhile the symptoms of MF can be mistaken for other conditions, talk to your doctor if you experience any of them. Being proactive can help you avoid any future complications.",https://www.healthline.com/health/myelofibrosis/symptoms-and-complications-of-myelofibrosis,Myelofibrosis,Symptoms and Complications of Myelofibrosis
91," What is myelofibrosis?Myelofibrosis (MF) is a type of bone marrow cancer. This condition affects how your body produces blood cells. MF is also a progressive disease that affects each person differently. Some people will have severe symptoms that progress quickly. Others may live for years without showing any symptoms.Read on to find out more about MF, including the outlook for this disease. Managing the pain that accompanies MFOne of the most common symptoms and complications of MF is pain. Causes vary, and can include:gout, which can lead to bone and joint painanemia, which also results in fatigueside effect of a treatmentIf you’re in a lot of pain, talk with your doctor about medications or other ways to keep it under control. Light exercise, stretching, and getting enough rest can also help manage pain. Side effects of treatment for MFTreatment side effects depend on many different factors. Not everyone will have the same side effects. Reactions depend on such variables as your age, treatment, and medication dosage. Your side effects may also relate to other health conditions you have or have had in the past.Some of the most common treatment side effects include: nauseadizzinesspain or tingling in the hands and feetfatigueshortness of breathfevertemporary hair lossSide effects usually go away after your treatment is completed. If you’re concerned about your side effects or you have trouble managing them, talk with your doctor about other options. Prognosis for MFPredicting the outlook for MF is difficult and depends on many factors.Although a staging system is used to measure the severity of many other types of cancer, there’s no staging system for MF.However, doctors and researchers have identified some factors that can help predict a person’s outlook. These factors are used in what’s called the international prognosis scoring system (IPSS) to help doctors predict average years of survival.“Myelofibrosis management has come a long way in the last 10 years. The list of effective myelofibrosis drugs is growing. These medications help patients live longer with fewer symptoms and better quality of life.”— Ivy Altomare, MDMeeting one of the factors below means the average survival rate is eight years. Meeting three or more can lower the expected survival rate to around two years. These factors include:being over the age of 65experiencing symptoms that affect your entire body, such as fever, fatigue, and weight losshaving anemia, or a low red blood cell counthaving an abnormally high white blood cell counthaving circulating blood blasts (immature white blood cells) greater than 1 percentYour doctor may also consider genetic abnormalities of the blood cells to help determine your outlook.People who don’t meet any of the above criteria, excluding age, are considered in the low-risk category and have a median survival of over 10 years.  Coping strategiesMF is a chronic, life-altering disease. Coping with the diagnosis and treatment can be difficult, but your doctor and healthcare team can help. It’s important to communicate with them openly. This can help you feel comfortable with the care you’re receiving. If you have questions or concerns, write them down as you think of them so you can discuss them with your doctors and nurses.Being diagnosed with a progressive disease like MF can create additional stress on your mind and body. Make sure to take care of yourself. Eating right and getting mild exercise like walking, swimming, or yoga will help give you energy. It can also help take your mind off the stress involved in having MF.Remember that it’s OK to seek support during your journey. Talking with your family and friends can help you feel less isolated and more supported. It will also help your friends and family learn how to support you. If you need their help with daily tasks like housework, cooking, or transportation — or to even just listen to you — it’s all right to ask.Sometimes you may not want to share everything with your friends or family, and that’s fine too. Many local and online support groups can help connect you with other people living with MF or similar conditions. These people can relate to what you’re going through and offer advice and encouragement.If you begin to feel overwhelmed by your diagnosis, consider talking with a trained mental health professional like a counselor or psychologist. They can help you understand and cope with your MF diagnosis on a deeper level.",https://www.healthline.com/health/myelofibrosis/prognosis-and-life-expectancy,Myelofibrosis,Myelofibrosis: Prognosis and Life Expectancy
92," OverviewAvascular necrosis (AVN) is a disease of the bone. Necrosis is a general term that means a cell has died. AVN is also called:osteonecrosisaseptic necrosisischemic bone necrosisbone infarctionAVN can lead to joint pain, especially the hip.The damage to the bone occurs from lack of blood flow to bone cells. That often happens from an injury. It’s also commonly due to damage from drinking too much alcohol or taking corticosteroids to manage a chronic health problem.Without treatment, eventually the space between joints can collapse, and the bones can lose their smooth shape. Osteoarthritis can develop. Some people with AVN will need joint replacement surgery.Read on to learn more about this condition. Symptoms of AVNThe hip bone is the most commonly affected joint with AVN. AVN also commonly affects the knee. Less often, AVN affects bones in these areas:shoulderwristanklehandsfeetIn its early stages, AVN may not cause symptoms. As blood cells die and the disease progresses, symptoms may occur in roughly this order:mild or severe pain in or around the affected jointgroin pain that spreads down to the kneepain that occurs when putting weight on the hip or kneejoint pain severe enough to limit movementPain may dramatically increase in intensity because of tiny breaks in the bone, called microfractures. These can cause the bone to collapse. Ultimately, the joint may break down and develop arthritis.The time between the first symptoms and the inability to move a joint varies. In general, it ranges from a few months to more than a year. Symptoms may appear bilaterally, meaning on both sides of the body.If AVN develops in the jaw, symptoms include exposed bone in the jaw bone with pain or pus, or both. Causes and risk factors for the conditionInjury that slows or stops blood flow to a bone is the main cause of AVN. Other common risks and causes of AVN are:drinking too much alcoholsmokingtaking high doses of corticosteroids for a long time, such as prednisone or cortisone, because they can increase fatty substances (lipids) in the blood, which can block arterieschildhood diseases including Legg-Calve Perthes diseaseIt’s not always clear what causes the problem with blood flow to the bone. Sometimes AVN affects healthy people. It may come on spontaneously, seemingly without a cause. Spontaneous AVN in the knee, for instance, is called SPONK or SONC.Some less common causes of AVN include:the bends, also called decompression sickness and caisson disease, a condition caused by the rapid release of nitrogen into the bloodtaking bisphosphates, such as zoledronate/zoledronic acid (Reclast, Zometa) or pamidronate to treat cancer in the bone (These drugs are associated with rare instances of AVN in the jaw.)chemotherapy or radiationhigh cholesterol, high triglycerides, or bothGaucher’s diseaseHIV infectionlupusorgan transplants, especially a kidney transplantpancreatitissickle cell anemia or other blood disordersMen develop AVN more than women unless the cause is injury or lupus. It most often affects people ages 30 to 60. But people of any age can develop AVN. How AVN is diagnosedYour doctor may check you for AVN if you have bone pain that is limited (localized) to a small area. To get a look at your bones, your doctor may recommend one or more of these imaging tests:X-ray: X-ray images may look normal in early stages of AVN. If you have AVN, your doctor will likely use X-rays to keep track of its progression.MRI scan: This type of imaging can help your doctor identify AVN in very early stages and before you experience symptoms. They also can show how much of the bone is affected.CT scan: This gives a 3-D picture of bone but is less sensitive than an MRI scan.Bone scan, also called nuclear bone scan or bone scintigraphy: Your doctor may recommend a bone scan if your X-rays are normal and you don’t have risk factors. This test requires that you get an IV with a harmless radioactive substance before the scan. The substance lets the doctor see inside the bones. A single bone scan finds any bones affected by AVN.Functional bone tests: If your doctor still suspects you have AVN even though your X-rays, MRIs, and bone scans were all normal, you may have tests to measure the pressure inside the painful bone. These tests require surgery.Dentists often find AVN in the jaw by seeing exposed bone during a mouth exam. Treatment for AVNTreatment for AVN depends on:your agethe cause of AVNwhich bones are damagedhow much damage there isTreatment is usually ongoing and changes as the disease progresses — from nonsurgical care to ease pain in the short term, to surgical care for lasting improvement. The goals of treatment are to:treat the cause of AVNreduce painhelp you use the affected jointstop further damage to the joint and prevent collapsekeep your bone and jointAVN in the jawMost of the time, surgery isn’t needed for AVN in the jaw. Treatment may include:removal of dead tissue, called debridementtaking antibioticsusing medicated mouthwashAVN in a small area of boneIf your doctor found AVN early before much damage has occurred, your treatment may include:taking pain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsreducing the risk of microfractures by using crutches or limiting activities, like walking, that put pressure on the affected jointdoing range-of-motion exercises to help you be able to keep using the affected jointtaking cholesterol-lowering medicines to improve blood flowSome studies show taking bisphosphonate medicines, such as risedronate (Actonel), alendronate (Binosto, Fosamax), and ibandronate, may help prevent bone collapse in the hip or knee, or even improve it. These drugs may also be used for the treatment of osteoporosis.AVN that is worsening or not responding to treatmentIf pain and use of your joint are getting worse, you may need surgery to ease pain, prevent the bones from collapsing, and preserve your joint. Your doctor may talk with you about one or more of the surgical optionsIn core decompression, a surgeon drills one or more holes to remove a core of bone from the affected joint. The goal is to ease pressure in the joint and to make channels for new blood vessels to improve blood flow.If AVN is caught early enough, this surgery may be able to prevent bone collapse and arthritis. Core decompression sometimes allows you to avoid a hip replacement later.While your bone heals and enriches its blood supply, you may need to use a walker or crutches. Recovery may take a few months, but many people who have this procedure have complete pain relief.Bone grafting is often done along with core decompression. A surgeon takes a small piece of healthy bone from another part of your body and grafts (transplants) it to replace the dead bone. Alternatively, the surgeon may use a donor or synthetic bone graft. This surgery improves blood flow and helps support the joint.If the surgeon also takes blood vessels with the bone piece, the procedure is called a vascular bone graft.It can take several months to recover from a bone graft.Vascularized fibula graft is a specific type of bone graft used for AVN in the hip. This surgery is more involved than some of the other options. A surgeon removes the small bone in your leg, called the fibula, as well as its artery and vein. The surgeon grafts this bone into the hole created by core decompression. Then the surgeon reattaches the blood vessels.Osteotomy is another option. A surgeon removes dead bone and also repositions, or reshapes, the healthy bone that remains. This helps reduce stress on and improve support of the joint so you can use it better.It can take several months of limited activities to recover from this surgery.Bones have collapsed or are destroyedTo restore the use of your hip and ease pain, a surgeon can replace your hip with an artificial one. This surgery is called total hip replacement, or arthroplasty. Your doctor will talk with you about the best type of replacement for you. Hip replacement eases pain and returns full use of the joint in about 90 to 95 percent of the people who have it. Outlook for this conditionMost people with AVN will eventually need surgery. With the right treatment, many people with AVN can lead an active life. It’s important to limit activities and follow your doctor’s advice to protect your joint. If you do develop osteoarthritis in the joint with AVN, you can work with a physical therapist to help ease pain and stiffness.A lot of research is being done to improve AVN treatment. How to prevent AVNYou may be able to prevent AVN by taking these actions:Avoid drinking too much alcohol.Avoid or quit smoking.If you need corticosteroids to manage a chronic illness, talk to your doctor about the smallest dose you can take for the shortest time.To specifically prevent AVN in the jaw:Brush your teeth and see your dentist for regular cleaning and screenings.See your dentist right away for jaw pain or gum problems, including swelling or redness. These can be signs of infection.If you need bisphosphonate treatment, have any dental work you need first. Also, be sure to take good care of your teeth while you take bisphosphonates.",https://www.healthline.com/health/avascular-necrosis-osteonecrosis,idiopathic avascular necrosis,Everything You Should Know About Avascular Necrosis (Osteonecrosis)
93,"Background and objectives: The course of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is still under analysis. The majority of complications arising from the infection are related to the respiratory system. The adverse effect of the viral infection on bone and joint tissue has also been observed. Materials and Methods: We present a group of 10 patients with degeneration of large joints and adjacent epiphyses of long bones and the spine, with a background of bone infarctions and avascular necrosis (AVN) immediately after infection with the COVID-19 virus. In MR imaging, changes in the characteristics of AVN were documented. Results: Observation of this group showed a clear correlation among the history of COVID-19 disease in the patients, moderately severe symptoms, high levels of IgG antibodies, and the time of occurrence of joint changes. No other clinically significant complications were observed following COVID-19 infection in the study group. No other risk factors for AVN or autoimmune or degenerative diseases were found in the study group. The group of patients responded well to empirical treatment with steroids, which normalized acute inflammatory symptoms and pain in the joints. Conclusions: During coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, there are complications in the locomotor system, such as microembolism and the formation of AVN; hence, more research is needed.

94,"            Avascular necrosis is a complicated, multifactorial disease with potentially devastating consequences. Although the underlying root cause is a lack of appropriate vascular perfusion to affected bone, there are often varying patient-specific, anatomic-specific, and injury-specific predispositions. These factors generally fall into 3 categories: direct vascular disruption, intravascular obliteration, or extravascular compression. The initial stages of disease can be insidiously symptomatic because edematous bone marrow progresses to subchondral collapse and subsequent degenerative arthritis. Although much of the current literature focuses on the femoral head, other common areas of occurrence include the proximal humerus, knee, and the carpus. The low-incidence rate of carpal avascular necrosis poses a challenge in establishing adequately powered, control-based validated treatment options, and therefore, optimal surgical management remains a continued debate among hand surgeons. Appreciation for expectant fracture healing physiology may help guide future investigation into carpal-specific causes of avascular necrosis.

95,"            Joint hypermobility is relatively common and has many influences such as age, gender, training, and ethnicity among many. Joint hypermobility may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. It may also be non-syndromic or syndromic. However, ""asymptomatic"" joint hypermobility may result in repetitive use injury, alter biomechanics of joints at other body sites, or become symptomatic later in life. Symptomatic joint hypermobility can result from soft-tissue rheumatism (e.g. bursitis, tendonitis, etc.) or muscular tension pain due to muscular imbalance. Generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) can be easily assessed using a standardized, quick, in-office examination. Management is relatively straight forward once joint hypermobility is recognized using neuromuscular re-training. It is important to recognize that GJH may also be a feature of a heritable connective tissue disorder with other systemic findings. Therefore, assessing joint hypermobility in those with musculoskeletal complaints may lead to recognizing systemic manifestations and allow the appropriate management.

96,"            Joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) was initially defined as the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the presence of joint laxity and hypermobility in otherwise healthy individuals. It is now perceived as a commonly overlooked, underdiagnosed, multifaceted, and multisystemic heritable disorder of connective tissue (HDCT), which shares many of the phenotypic features of other HDCTs such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Whereas the additional flexibility can confer benefits in terms of mobility and agility, adverse effects of tissue laxity and fragility can give rise to clinical consequences that resonate far beyond the confines of the musculoskeletal system. There is hardly a clinical specialty to be found that is not touched in one way or another by JHS. Over the past decade, it has become evident that of all the complications that may arise in JHS, chronic pain is arguably the most menacing and difficult to treat.

97," October 2010 Print this issueHealth CapsuleVirus Linked to Chronic Fatigue SyndromeSend us your commentsScientists have new evidence that viruses may play a role in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This debilitating disease affects millions of people nationwide.A main symptom of CFS is profound fatigue that persists even after resting. Other symptoms include problems thinking or remembering, sleeping difficulties, achy joints, headache and stomach and digestive problems.No definite cause for CFS has yet been found. Last year, scientists reported that the blood of patients with CFS contained evidence of a virus called XMRV. It’s related to a virus that causes leukemia in mice. However, other research groups were later unable to find traces of similar viruses in CFS patients.To take a closer look, scientists from NIH and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration searched for DNA evidence of similar viruses in both CFS patients and healthy blood donors. The researchers found traces of the mouse-related viruses in 32 of 37 (86.5%) of the CFS patients, compared to only 3 of 44 (6.8%) healthy donors.The study doesn’t prove that the viruses cause CFS, but suggests there’s some type of association. It’s possible that viruses related to mouse leukemia virus cause CFS in only some patients. “At this point, we just don’t know. We haven’t studied enough people,” says study coauthor Dr. Harvey J. Alter of NIH’s Clinical Center.Complicating the matter is the fact that no specific test is yet available to confirm that someone has CFS. NIH is now leading an effort to test and develop standardized laboratory techniques for detecting XMRV and related viruses.",https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2010/10/virus-linked-chronic-fatigue-syndrome,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,Virus Linked to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
98,"          Background:                    Joint Hypermobility Syndrome (JHS) is a rare Heritable Disorder of Connective tissue characterised by generalised joint laxity and chronic widespread pain. Joint Hypermobility Syndrome has a large impact on patients' day to day activities, and many complain of symptoms when standing for prolonged periods. This study investigates whether people with JHS exhibit the same behaviours to deal with the effects of prolonged standing as people with equal hypermobility and no pain, and people with normal flexibility and no pain.              Methods:                    Twenty three people with JHS, 22 people with Generalised Joint Hypermobility (GJH), and 22 people with normal flexibility (NF) were asked to stand for a maximum of 15 min across two force-plates. Fidgets were counted and quantified using a cumulative sum algorithm and sway parameters of the quiet standing periods between fidgets were calculated.              Results:                    Average standing time for participants with JHS was 7.35 min and none stood for the full 15 min. All participants with GJH and NF completed 15 min of standing. There were no differences in fidgeting behaviour between any groups. There was a difference in anteroposterior sway (p = .029) during the quiet standing periods.              Conclusion:                    There is no evidence to suggest people with JHS exhibit different fidgeting behaviour. Increased anteroposterior-sway may suggest a muscle weakness and strengthening muscles around the ankle may reduce postural sway and potentially improve the ability to stand for prolonged periods.

99,"Share on PinterestImagine this. You’re going about life happily. You share your life with the man of your dreams. You have a few kids, a job you enjoy most of the time, and hobbies and friends to keep you busy. Then, one day, your mother-in-law moves in.You’re not sure why. You didn’t invite her, and you’re pretty sure your husband didn’t, either. You keep thinking she’ll leave, but you notice her bags have been thoroughly unpacked, and every time you bring up her impending departure, she changes the subject.Well, this is not unlike how I came to have chronic fatigue syndrome. You see, for me, as is the case for most people with CFS, chronic fatigue syndrome arrived in the form of what I thought was a simple stomach flu. As you would for a short-stay visit with your mother-in-law, I mentally prepared for a few days of misery and unpleasant interruptions and assumed life would return to normal in a few days. This was not the case. The symptoms, particularly a crushing fatigue, took up residence in my body, and, five years on, it would appear that my metaphorical mother-in-law has moved in for good.It’s not the ideal situation, and it’s one that continues to perplex me, but it’s not all bad news. The years of living with “her” have taught me a few things. Having this wealth of information now, I think everyone should know that … 1. Living with CFS is not all bad.Like any respectable MIL-DIL relationship, life with chronic fatigue has its ups and downs. At times, you can’t lift your head off the pillow for fear of her wrath. But other times, if you tread lightly, you might go weeks, even months, without significant confrontation.2. Living with your “mother-in-law” comes with some perks.The other day a friend asked me if I wanted to join her in canvassing the neighborhood selling chocolate almonds. The answer was an easy, “No. I’ll be entertaining my mother-in-law tonight.” Living with this less-than-desirable house guest doesn’t come with many up-sides, so I figure using it as a (valid) excuse now and then is fair.3. You can’t beat your mother-in-law.Though you’d like to, you can’t beat CFS physically or metaphorically as some might “beat,” or cure, another disease. Any attempts to fight, defy, or otherwise defeat it only make living with it worse. Having said that …4. A little kindness goes a long way.When dealing with this unwanted resident in my life, I have found it best to simply exercise kindness in all ways. A nurturing, peaceful, and patient approach will often yield periods of what is known in CFS lingo as “remission” — a period of time in which symptoms ease and one can increase their levels of activity.5. Do NOT, under any circumstances, involve your mother-in-law in extreme sports.The real kicker of CFS is a nasty little thing called post-exertional malaise. Simply put, this is the all-kinds-of-terrible you feel 24 to 48 hours after participating in rigorous physical activity. So while your mother-in-law may appear to be enjoying her time on the BMX track, make no mistake, she will make you pay later. There will be no telling what injuries she may acquire and how long you will have to hear about them.6. Whatever you do: Choose your battles.Chronic fatigue syndrome never misses a chance to be heard when, say, you have a late night with friends or you try to do some strenuous gardening. Knowing this, I only go to battle with this illness when it’s worth it. For me, this means saying no to things like the office social or volunteering for the PTA. But a Garth Brooks concert? HELL YEAH!7. You won’t win every battle.My metaphorical mother-in-law is a formidable character. There will definitely be bad times that in CFS-speak we call “relapse.” When this happens, I can’t stress enough the power of accepting defeat as the first step towards recovery. For my own sake, I use these times to drink a lot of tea with the MIL, reassure her that everything will be OK, and convince her to watch Downton Abbey with me until she’s ready to bury the hatchet.8. Throw her a bone now and then.It might feel like your MIL is needy at times. She wants to rest, she doesn’t want to dig the weeds today, work is too stressful for her, she wants to be in bed no later than 8:00 p.m. … The list goes on and on. For goodness sake, throw her bone now and then! No. Scratch that. Throw her all the bones she wants and then some. I promise you the pay-off in terms of your health will be worth it.9. The best of friends don’t mind if MIL tags along.I’ve always had good friends, but I’ve never appreciated them more than in the past five years. They are good and faithful and don’t mind if my mother-in-law decides to slow us down on an outing — or even if she insists that the whole lot of us stay home instead!10. Accept the things you cannot change.I didn’t agree to this whole living arrangement. I’ve begged and pleaded for my MIL to take up residence elsewhere. I’ve even left her things on the doorstep, hoping she’d get the hint, but to no avail. It would appear she’s here to stay, and it’s better to …11. Change the things you can.No doubt, when an illness barges into your life unannounced and takes up residence, it can leave you feeling angry, defeated, and powerless. For me, there came a point, though, where those feelings needed to take a back seat to a more constructive focus on the things I could change. For example, I could be a mom. I could take tai chi, and I could pursue a new career in writing. These are things I find enjoyable, fulfilling, and, best of all, my “mother-in-law” finds them quite agreeable too!If one thing has become clear over my journey with this illness, it’s that we are all called to make the best of our living situations. Who knows? One day I might wake up and my metaphorical roommate may have found herself other accommodations. But, safe to say, I’m not holding my breath. For today, I’m happy to make the best of it and take the lessons as they come. How do you deal with chronic fatigue syndrome?

100,"Share on PinterestLucy Lambriex/Getty ImagesChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) (also called myalgic encephalomyelitis) is a chronic illness that causes a broad range of symptoms.Don’t let the name fool you. The “fatigue” associated with CFS isn’t simple tiredness. It can be life altering and make even the smallest routine tasks feel impossible, especially when sleep doesn’t restore energy after each night.There’s no cure for CFS. As a result, treatment is personalized and focused on relieving symptoms and restoring quality of life. Here’s more about what treatments may be best for you.How serious is chronic fatigue syndrome?CFS isn’t common, as it affects roughly 0.7% of the U.S. population at most. Experts estimate that around 1 million people have CFS. But the actual number of people may sit anywhere between 836,000 and 2.5 million, including those who have yet to receive a clear diagnosis. People assigned female at birth are two to four times more likely to have the condition than people assigned male at birth.What are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome?CFS is serious. The condition makes daily life difficult for people who deal with it.Symptoms include:severe sleep issueschronic painorthostatic intolerancedizzinesscognition issuesPeople with CFS may need to spend much of the day in bed. At the very least, they may not be able to carry out their responsibilities or other desired activities without dealing with symptoms. This may eventually lead to missing work, being socially isolated, and dealing with depression.Even small amounts of activity can trigger something called postexertional malaise (PEM), which can prolong symptoms, make symptoms worse, or both.Does chronic fatigue ever go away?The median recovery rate for CFS is around 5%. It’s important to know that many people can manage their condition and energy level by creating a personalized treatment plan with a doctor.Beyond that, you may find that your symptoms change, get worse, or get better over time. Symptoms may even come and go somewhat unpredictably. Your experience will be unique and tied to your own triggers and coexisting health conditions.How do you treat chronic fatigue syndrome?There’s no one medication a person can take to treat CFS. Instead, treatment is highly individual and depends on what symptoms a person is experiencing. The areas of treatment generally include:PEMsleeppainmental health (anxiety, stress, depression)orthostatic intoleranceconcentration and cognition issuesDiscussing treatment options with a doctorThe medical community differs over the exact treatment courses for those living with CFS. You’ll need to work closely with a healthcare team to determine which symptoms are impacting your quality of life the most.You may start with treatment of these issues and progress to others in time. Many treatment options are available, ranging from over-the-counter (OTC) drugs to alternative therapies.What is the most effective treatment for this condition?The most effective treatment for CFS is the one that’s catered to you and your specific symptoms. A doctor may suggest a variety of treatments depending on what you’re experiencing and what your treatment goals are.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a treatment that helps people understand and adjust the ways they think and respond to various situations. While CBT is a psychological treatment, it’s appropriate for chronic illnesses like CFS (and others). This treatment may work best for people with mild to moderate CFS. It involves attending a set number of therapy sessions in which you’ll focus on things like unhelpful ways of thinking, unhelpful behaviors, coping mechanisms, and relaxation techniques.Activity managementActivity management can be an effective treatment for PEM. Another term you may be more familiar with for this type of energy management is “pacing.”This treatment is usually carried out by a rehabilitation specialist or exercise physiologist. You may start by keeping a log of your usual activities and how they affect your energy levels. Some refer to this as the “spoon theory” in life with a chronic illness, where a spoon to represents a unit of energy.From there, a healthcare professional will help you find ways to do these tasks in different ways to conserve energy. For example, you may try folding your laundry while seated or taking frequent breaks throughout the day.Pacing is all about finding a balance between those activities that zap energy and those that may restore it.An energy management plan may also include a personalized exercise plan.MedicationsAgain, there’s no one medication you can take to treat CFS as a condition. Drugs that may help symptoms include:OTC medications (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc.) to help with pain and muscle or joint issues prescription medications to help with more severe painprescription medications to help with sleep issuesantidepressants or anti-anxiety medications to help with mood disordersblood pressure or heart rhythm drugs to help with orthostatic intoleranceSleep treatmentSleep is difficult with CFS. You may not get enough sleep, or even if you do, your sleep may not be restorative.If OTC treatments don’t help with sleep, a healthcare professional may refer you to a sleep specialist to determine if you have other conditions, such as sleep apnea or narcolepsy, that may be contributing to your sleep problems.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis. With sleep apnea, for example, you may use a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine to help with breathing overnight.Lifestyle changesThere are a variety of alternative methods or changes to your lifestyle that may help with CFS as well:People dealing with orthostatic intolerance may try increasing salt intake, drinking more water, or wearing support stockings.People with memory or thinking problems may benefit from using organizers or calendars to keep track of important information.People with anxiety and depression may try meditation, yoga, deep breathing, massage, and other techniques for relaxation and restoration.People with pain may try massage, physical therapy, or acupuncture for pain management.A doctor may also suggest using certain supplements to address nutrition deficiencies, diet changes to support a balanced diet, or a combination of both traditional and alternative therapies to get you feeling better.What are the newest treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome?Researchers share that there are some newer treatments or trial treatments for CFS. A doctor may also know of newer treatments or other options available to you.They include:Rintatolimod: This immunomodulator and antiviral medication is currently only approved in Canada and Europe. While U.S. researchers do believe there’s some promise, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says it doesn’t have enough safety or efficacy information to approve it. Rituximab: This monoclonal antibody treatment causes “the depletion of B cells” in the body. Researchers explain that B cells may be responsible for causing CFS in some people.Fecal microbiota transplantation: This treatment involves taking bacteria from a healthy “donor” and transplanting it into another person’s gut (also called bacteriotherapy). More research is needed to assess the full benefit for people with CFS and other conditions, but researchers say it looks promising.Aripiprazole: Traditionally used to treat bipolar disorder (among other conditions), this drug may be a possible treatment for CFS. The study was small, but many of the participants (75 out of 101) experienced an improvement in their fatigue and brain fog symptoms. TakeawayCFS does more than just make people tired. It’s a potentially debilitating condition that causes both physical and psychological symptoms. Treatment plans vary from person to person and can include medications, therapy, complementary and alternative medicine, and more. If you’re struggling, speak with a doctor about your symptoms and your treatment goals. While CFS can’t be cured, certain medications, pacing, and other treatments and lifestyle changes can help you get your life back.",https://www.healthline.com/health/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-treatment,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,How Is Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Treated?
101,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder characterized by extreme fatigue or tiredness that doesn’t go away with rest and can’t be explained by an underlying medical condition.CFS can also be referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID).The causes of CFS aren’t fully understood yet. Some theories include viral infection, psychological stress, or a combination of factors.Because no single cause has been identified, and because many other conditions produce similar symptoms, CFS can be difficult to diagnose.There are no tests for CFS. Your doctor will have to rule out other causes for your fatigue when determining a diagnosis.While CFS was previously a controversial diagnosis, it’s now widely accepted as a medical condition.CFS can affect anyone, though it’s most common among women in their 40s and 50s. There’s currently no cure, but treatment can relieve symptoms.Here’s what you need to know about CFS, including symptoms, treatment options, and outlook.What causes CFS?The cause of CFS is unknown. Researchers speculate that contributing factors may include:virusesa weakened immune systemstresshormonal imbalancesIt’s also possible that some people are genetically predisposed to develop CFS.Though CFS can sometimes develop after a viral infection, no single type of infection has been found to cause CFS. Some viral infections that have been studied in relation to CFS include those caused by:Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)human herpesvirus 6Ross River virus (RRV)rubella virusInfections caused by bacteria, including Coxiella burnetii and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been studied in relation to CFS.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested that CFS may be the end stage of multiple different conditions, rather than one specific condition.In fact, about 1 in 10 people with EBV, Ross River virus, or Coxiella burnetii infection will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis.Additionally, researchers say that those who’ve had severe symptoms with any of these three infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS.People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder.People with CFS can also sometimes have abnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either.Risk factors for CFSCFS is most commonly seen among people in their 40s and 50s.Sex also plays an important role in CFS, as women are two to four times more likely to be diagnosed with CFS than men.Other factors that may increase your risk for CFS include:genetic predispositionallergiesstressenvironmental factorsWhat are the symptoms of CFS?Symptoms of CFS vary based on the individual and the severity of the condition.The most common symptom is fatigue that’s severe enough to interfere with your daily activities.For CFS to be diagnosed, a significantly reduced ability to perform your usual daily activities with fatigue must last for at least 6 months. It must not be curable with bed rest.You will also experience extreme fatigue after physical or mental activities, which is referred to as post-exertional malaise (PEM). This can last for more than 24 hours after the activity.CFS can also introduce sleep problems, such as:feeling unrefreshed after a night’s sleepchronic insomniaother sleep disordersIn addition, you may also experience:loss of memoryreduced concentrationorthostatic intolerance (going from lying or seated to standing positions makes you light-headed, dizzy, or faint)Physical symptoms of CFS may include:muscle painfrequent headachesmulti-joint pain without redness or swellingfrequent sore throattender and swollen lymph nodes in your neck and armpitsCFS affects some people in cycles, with periods of feeling worse and then better.Symptoms may sometimes even disappear completely, which is referred to as remission. However, it’s still possible for symptoms to return later, which is referred to as a relapse.This cycle of remission and relapse can make it difficult to manage your symptoms, but it’s possible.How is CFS diagnosed?CFS is a very challenging condition to diagnose.According to the Institute of Medicine, as of 2015, CFS occurs in about 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans. It’s estimated, however, that 84 to 91 percent have yet to receive a diagnosis.There are no medical tests to screen for CFS. Its symptoms are similar to many other conditions. Many people with CFS don’t “look sick,” so doctors may not recognize that they indeed have a health condition.In order to receive a CFS diagnosis, your doctor will rule out other potential causes and review your medical history with you.They’ll confirm that you at least have the core symptoms previously mentioned. They’ll also ask about the duration and severity of your unexplained fatigue.Ruling out other potential causes of your fatigue is a key part of the diagnosis process. Some conditions with symptoms that resemble those of CFS include:mononucleosisLyme diseasemultiple sclerosislupus (SLE)hypothyroidismfibromyalgiamajor depressive disordersevere obesitysleep disordersThe side effects of certain drugs, such as antihistamines and alcohol, can mimic symptoms of CFS as well.Because of the similarities between symptoms of CFS and many other conditions, it’s important to not self-diagnose. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms. They can work with you to get relief.How is CFS treated?There’s currently no specific cure for CFS.Each person has different symptoms and therefore may require different types of treatment to manage the disorder and relieve their symptoms.Work with your team of healthcare providers to create the best treatment plan for you. They can go over the possible benefits and side effects of the therapies with you.Addressing post-exertional malaise (PEM) symptomsPEM occurs when even minor physical, mental, or emotional exertion results in CFS symptoms becoming worse.Worsening symptoms usually occur 12 to 48 hours after the activity and last for days or even weeks.Activity management, also called pacing, can help balance rest and activity to avoid PEM flare-ups. You’ll need to find your individual limits for mental and physical activities, plan these activities, and then rest to stay within these limits.Some doctors refer to staying within these limits as the “energy envelope.” Keeping a diary of your activities may help you find your personal limits.It’s important to note that while vigorous aerobic exercise is good for most chronic conditions, people with CFS don’t tolerate such exercise routines.Home remedies and lifestyle changesMaking some lifestyle changes may help reduce your symptoms.Limiting or eliminating your caffeine intake can help you sleep better and ease your insomnia. You should limit or avoid nicotine and alcohol too.Try to avoid napping during the day if it’s hurting your ability to sleep at night.Create a sleep routine. Go to bed at the same time every night and aim to wake up around the same time every day.MedicationsTypically, no one medication can treat all of your symptoms. Also, your symptoms may change over time, so your medications may have to as well.In many cases, CFS can trigger or be a symptom of depression. You may need low-dose antidepressant therapy or a referral to a mental health provider.If lifestyle changes don’t give you a restful night’s sleep, your doctor may suggest a sleep aid. Pain-reducing medication can also help you cope with aches and joint pain caused by CFS.If medication therapy is needed, it will have to be tailored for your needs. Work closely with your doctor. There’s no one-size-fits-all treatment for CFS.Alternative medicineAcupuncture, tai chi, yoga, and massage may help relieve the pain associated with CFS. Always talk to your doctor before beginning any alternative or complementary treatments.What can be expected in the long term?Despite increased research efforts, CFS remains a complex condition with no exact known cause and cure. The recovery rate is only 5%. Managing CFS can therefore be challenging.You’ll likely need to make lifestyle changes to adapt to your chronic fatigue. As a result, you may experience depression, anxiety, or social isolation. You might find that joining a support group can be helpful as you’re making decisions and transitions.CFS progresses differently in everyone, so it’s important to work with your doctor to create a treatment plan that meets your needs.Many people benefit from working with a team of healthcare providers. This can include doctors, therapists, and rehabilitation specialists.If you’re living with CFS, the Solve ME/CFS Initiative has resources that you may find helpful. The CDC also offers recommendations for managing and living with CFS.",https://www.healthline.com/health/chronic-fatigue-syndrome,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome)
102,"Severe fatigue, chronic pain, brain fog, difficulties with day-to-day tasks — these are just a few of the often disabling symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. Millions of people across the globe, up to about 2.5 million people in the United States alone, are believed to be affected by this condition, and many don’t have a formal diagnosis. One of the reasons for this is the lack of a specific test for chronic fatigue syndrome. In this article, we take a look at how doctors currently diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome, along with their recommendations for long-term management of the symptoms.What is chronic fatigue syndrome?Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), sometimes referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), is a chronic condition that’s characterized by severe chronic fatigue.CFS can be so severe that makes it difficult for a person to perform their day-to-day activities. They may not be able to fulfill work or school obligations, engage in social activities, or even perform basic tasks like cooking a meal or taking a shower. In severe cases, they may not even be able to leave bed.When people with CFS do attempt to perform these activities, they often experience a worsening of symptoms called post-exertional malaise (PEM). During PEM, other symptoms of CFS, like sleep difficulties, cognitive impairment, and chronic pain, can flare up.Researchers are not entirely sure what causes CFS. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), possible causes may include:certain viral or bacterial infectionschanges to the immune systemunderlying biochemical differencesgeneticsIs there a blood test that can help diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome?Currently, there’s no blood test that has been approved to help diagnose CFS. A pilot study from 2019 explored a blood test that would allow doctors to screen for certain cellular markers related to ME/CFS. In this study, the researchers used an ultrasensitive blood test to determine if there were any notable cellular differences in participants with CFS.Results of the blood test showed that the immune cells of participants with CFS showed a much different response when exposed to stress than the cells of healthy participants. Given these results, the researchers believe that their test could potentially be a low-cost, minimally invasive, and reliable way to help diagnose CFS.This test has yet to be approved as a diagnostic blood test for CFS. However, the National Institutes of Health believes this study could be the first step in developing a standard test. More research is needed.How is chronic fatigue syndrome typically diagnosed?Without an official blood test to help diagnose CFS, it can take years for people to receive a diagnosis. Here’s what doctors currently look for when making a diagnosis:Substantial impairment: CFS causes significant impairment in someone’s ability to do activities at home, school, work, or in social settings. This impairment usually comes as a result of severe, persistent fatigue that doesn’t get better with rest.Post-exertional malaise (PEM): After engaging in mental or physical activities, CFS can cause PEM, which is a worsening of chronic fatigue symptoms. PEM tends to appear within 12 to 48 hours after the “exertion” and can last for days or weeks.Trouble sleeping: Chronic fatigue syndrome can cause difficulties sleeping, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or the inability to feel refreshed after sleeping. Not feeling refreshed even after a full night’s sleep is one of the hallmark symptoms of CFS.Cognitive difficulties: When someone has CFS, they may struggle with decreased cognitive function. Sometimes referred to as “brain fog,” cognitive impairment can cause trouble with memory, information processing, concentration, and even language comprehension.Orthostatic intolerance: Orthostatic intolerance refers to the development of symptoms, such as dizziness, that happen when moving from a reclining to an upright position. While CFS isn’t the only condition to cause this, people with CFS often experience symptoms when sitting or standing up.To receive a diagnosis of CFS, a person must have experienced significant impairment, PEM, and unrefreshing sleep, a majority of the time, for a period of at least 6 months. They must also experience either cognitive impairment, orthostatic intolerance, or both.What other conditions can mimic chronic fatigue syndrome?One of the most important steps in receiving an accurate diagnosis of CFS is ruling out similar conditions. According to the CDC, conditions that may appear similar to CFS include:anemiaautoimmune conditionscertain cancersdiabetes mellitusdisordered eatingdrug side effectsfibromyalgiagenetic disordershormonal imbalanceshyperthyroidismhypothyroidismlupusLyme diseasemental health conditionsmononucleosismultiple sclerosissleep disordersIf you suspect that you might have CFS, your doctor will likely make sure that no other underlying conditions are causing your symptoms before making a diagnosis.How do doctors treat chronic fatigue syndrome?There’s currently no cure for CFS. However, treatment options exist to help people with this condition manage their chronic symptoms and make it easier to function in daily life.Activity pacingActivity management — also called pacing — is an approach that can help prevent PEM (sometimes called a flare-up) in people with CFS. One of the most important elements of pacing is finding one’s physical and mental limits. By finding these limits, people with CFS can avoid triggering a flare-up of their symptoms.Activity/sleep/symptom logs, heart rate trackers, and activity/exercise plans can all be especially helpful tools for activity management.Sleep habitsCreating better sleep habits is important for everyone, but healthy sleep habits don’t always make a huge difference for people with CFS. When this is the case, other options can be considered. These include medications that can help someone fall asleep, stay asleep, or wake up feeling more refreshed.If sleep medications aren’t helping with the sleep-related symptoms of CFS, it can be helpful to meet with a sleep specialist to explore more options.Pain managementMany people with CFS also deal with chronic pain, including headaches, joint and muscle pain, and skin soreness. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can be helpful for managing some of these chronic pain symptoms.Sometimes, OTC pain meds aren’t enough. This is where a pain specialist can step in. Pain specialists help people with chronic pain learn how to better manage their pain through other treatment options and lifestyle changes.Certain medicationsMedications can play a role in the treatment of CFS by helping to reduce the symptoms of other conditions, like chronic pain, cognitive problems, or mental health conditions. For example, antidepressants can help ease the symptoms of depression and anxiety that may be present with CFS.However, it’s always important to consider the side effects of these medications to ensure that they won’t make someone’s CFS symptoms worse.Graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapyRecommended treatment for CFS may also include graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Graded exercise therapy is a doctor-controlled exercise program that starts with very gentle exercises — such as 5 minutes of stretching per day — and is increased gradually over time as a person gains strength. Combining a graded exercise program with CBT is recommended because it can help a person become more aware of their body’s capabilities and limits. This is important because overexertion can exacerbate symptoms of chronic fatigue.More research is needed to prove the effectiveness of these two methods for treating CFS.Lifestyle changesCFS is a condition that requires careful and constant management and support. Lifestyle changes, such as going to therapy and eating a balanced diet, are not a cure for CFS, but they may help reduce certain symptoms.Talk with a doctor about creating a treatment plan that works for youIt’s important to remember that there’s no one “treatment” for CFS. Everyone has different symptoms, so what works for one person may not work for another person.If you’ve received a diagnosis of CFS, discuss your symptoms with your doctor and work together to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you.Frequently asked questions about chronic fatigue syndromeWhen will a diagnostic blood test for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) be available? Although a pilot study published in 2019 showed promise for a potential CFS blood test, there’s still no singular test that can help diagnose this condition. However, scientists across the globe, such as those involved in Stanford’s Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Initiative, are working hard to find new diagnostic and treatment options for CFS.Does chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) ever go away? There’s currently no cure for CFS. But people with the condition tend to cycle between two states: flare-ups and remission. When someone is in remission, the symptoms of CFS may be mild or disappear altogether. However, symptoms can reappear at any time if a flare-up is triggered.Can a specific diet or other lifestyle changes help with symptoms? Some people with CFS find that certain dietary habits or lifestyle changes can make their symptoms feel better. But although these management techniques may help alleviate the severity of symptoms in some people, they may not work for everyone and they’re not a cure for CFS.Do I have chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or long-haul COVID-19?Long-haul COVID-19 symptoms, such as severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and even PEM, can mimic those found in CFS. If you’ve recently had COVID-19 and noticed persistent symptoms even after recovering, talk with a doctor. They can help narrow down whether you have long COVID, CFS, or something else.TakeawayWithout an official blood test for CFS, it can be difficult to get a diagnosis. And even once you do have a diagnosis, you may be left with more questions than you started with — especially when it comes to treatment options and the long-term management of your symptoms.If you or someone you love has received a diagnosis of CFS, consider reaching out to a CFS specialist for more information. They can tell you what your treatment options are, and how best to move forward.",https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-test-for-chronic-fatigue-syndrome,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,Can a Blood Test Help Diagnose Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?
103,"New research suggests a common biomarker for inflammation is present for years in people with chronic fatigue syndrome.People with chronic fatigue syndrome often have trouble explaining why they feel exhausted and in pain.Much like a mental illness, many people suffering from the illness have had their symptoms dismissed as being “all in their heads.”But that’s not necessarily true.New research shows the first “robust” evidence that chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) — medically known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) — is a physical disorder that may be kick-started by an infection.“We now have evidence confirming what millions of people with this disease already know, that ME/CFS isn’t psychological,” Dr. Mady Hornig director of translational research at the Center for Infection and Immunity and associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia’s Mailman School, said in a press release.Researchers at Columbia published a study identifying changes in a person’s immune system that then lead to the disorder.“This study delivers what has eluded us for so long: unequivocal evidence of immunological dysfunction in ME/CFS and diagnostic biomarkers for disease,” Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity and professor of neurology and pathology at Columbia’s Mailman School, said. Get the Facts: Scientists Find Markers in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome » Infection Could Trigger Lasting Immune ResponseThe Columbia team says their research supports the hypothesis that CFS may be triggered in a “hit-and-run” fashion following a common infection, such as infectious mononucleosis.The cross-sectional study, published in the journal Science Advances, involved analyzing the blood plasma samples of 298 CFS patients and 348 people without the disease.The researchers found distinct biomarkers created by the immune system in those with the disease. They also found differences in those who have had the disease for less than three years and those who have had it more than three years.Those who had the disease for a shorter extent of time had higher amounts of different types of cytokines, or molecules that regulate your body’s defensive response to inflammation and infection.Specifically, the Columbia team reports, early-stage CFS patients have elevated levels of interleukin-17A, a known biomarker of a faulty immune system.The researchers added the elevated biomarker levels seem to subside after three years because the immune system has become exhausted after failing to calm itself after an infection. They compared it to an engine running at high gear for an extended period of time.“Our results should accelerate the process of establishing the diagnosis after individuals first fall ill as well as discovery of new treatment strategies focusing on these early blood markers,” Hornig, lead author of the study, said.Proper diagnosis for CFS has been historically troublesome. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimate that up to 91 percent of the 2.5 million people who have chronic fatigue have not yet been diagnosed.Earlier this month, an expert panel at the IOM recommended chronic fatigue be labeled as a systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) and established diagnostic criteria that better reflect scientific research. Related News: Term ‘Chronic Fatigue’ Doesn’t Fully Explain Illness » A Common Culprit in Autoimmune DisordersInterleukin-17A doesn’t only affect people with CFS.High levels of this specific cytokine are associated with many chronic inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis.Interleukin-17A is a potential target for biologic treatments designed to dampen the body’s immune system to relieve symptoms of these conditions.In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Cosentyx (secukinumab), a psoriasis drug that targets interleukin-17A to quiet the body’s immune response.Psoriasis, an autoimmune disorder, can also be triggered by an infection. CFS is a common complaint of people with psoriatic arthritis, an inflammatory joint condition that can develop in people in late-stage psoriasis.But before researchers would test existing or experimental drugs on CFS patients to target interleukin-17A, they say they need to replicate their results in a study that follows patients to observe how their cytokine levels differ over time.Before there can be effective treatments for CFS, there must be a better understanding of CFS so it can be diagnosed earlier.“Early diagnosis may provide unique opportunities for treatment that likely differ from those that would be appropriate in later phases of the illness,” Hornig said.

104,"Chronic fatigue is one of the most common symptoms of long COVID. Lumi Nola/Getty ImagesExperts are expressing concerns that the growing number of people with long-haul COVID-19, or long COVID, could create a new wave of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome.They say this increase could challenge the resources at healthcare facilities as well as family and friends of those with the syndrome.Experts note that research into treatments for long COVID could also help develop new therapies for chronic fatigue.Life after COVID-19 could pose some significant challenges, with experts warning there may be an influx of people who develop chronic fatigue syndrome.Chronic fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms among those with long COVID, and experts say the increasing number of people dealing with fatigue due to COVID-19 could have a significant social impact.“Many people may have fatigue after COVID infection, and fatigue lasting more than 4 weeks may occur in about 40 percent of people after initial infection,” Dr. Dean Blumberg, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Davis, told Healthline.“Long-term fatigue can severely impact the quality of life for those individuals affected, as well as their families and loved ones,” he added. “From a societal perspective, it is concerning if a substantial portion of the population is affected due to the additional healthcare resources that will be needed for their care, as well as the lost or delayed educational or economic opportunities.”The research on long COVIDResearchers have been investigating the potential health issues in a post-pandemic world and report notable similarities between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome, which is also known as CFS or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).One 2021 study collected information from more than 3,000 people in 56 countries who had COVID-19 and experienced symptoms lasting longer than 28 days.The researchers noted several similarities between long COVID and CFS.At 6 months with long COVID, study participants reported three common symptoms: fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise (PEM).PEM occurs if someone has worse symptoms following physical or mental activity.This mirrors what happens in CFS, when people may find it difficult to do the tasks they want to do.The same study found that nearly half of the participants had to reduce their workload due to their symptoms, and 22 percent were unable to work at all.The challenges to healthcareDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, says the number of people dealing with ongoing symptoms such as fatigue due to long COVID is going to present new challenges to the healthcare system.“The anticipation is that this will be a requirement/demand on the medical care system that we hadn’t had pre-COVID. But we’re now going to have to deal with in a more sustained fashion,” Schaffner told Healthline.“This will have implications for those affected individuals and how well they can work and be reintegrated into societal activities of all kinds, as well as the costs associated with caring for those individuals,” he added.It’s estimated that between 836,000 and 2.5 million people in the United States live with CFS/ME, but many of them are undiagnosed.Experts are currently debating whether those experiencing long COVID may also be experiencing CFS, or something else.“There is some overlap, but we are not sure where the overlap is and where the long COVID-19 fits into the chronic fatigue yet,” Dr. Adupa Rao, a pulmonologist and specialist in the Keck Medicine of USC COVID Recovery Clinic in California, told Healthline.“The overlap makes this confusing. The reason for separating out the two is to give it a label so that if a specific therapy is found to be more beneficial in long COVID-19, then that would be the therapy given to treat the person,” he added.Currently, there is no known cause or treatment for CFS/ME, but experts are hopeful that research into long COVID may provide some answers for those living with CFS/ME.“Because some of the symptoms are the same between CFS and long COVID, and because the cause may be similar in that both may be due to the immune responses following an acute infection, then increased understanding of the pathogenesis of long COVID may further our understanding of the causes of CFS,” Blumberg said. “Similarly, finding the best treatment outcomes for long COVID may translate to improved treatment of CFS.”Looking toward the futureWith potentially 1 million or more people affected by lasting fatigue due to COVID-19, experts say the challenge ahead is significant.However, Schaffner believes the establishment of clinics specifically to support those with long COVID is a promising start.“Medical centers, such as my own, have actually created long COVID clinics as a means of trying to start to learn more about this syndrome, trying to help patients cope with the symptoms,” he said.“We do know that many people do improve. Let’s work together to try to maximize your improvements… let’s try to restore as much function as we can. Although we can’t promise you how far you will come in the rehab, we can promise you, we’re here,” he said.",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/will-long-covid-create-a-new-wave-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,Will Long COVID Create a New Wave of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?

These seven habits are summarized from her book, the Amazon bestselling “Everyday Healing: Stand Up, Take Charge, and Get Your Health Back… One Day at a Time.” My husband and I call 2002 to 2008 “The Dark Years.” Virtually overnight, I went from a high-energy go-getter to being mostly bedridden, with intense aches, debilitating fatigue, vertigo, and intermittent bronchitis.Doctors gave me various diagnoses, but chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or “an unknown autoimmune disorder” seemed like the most accurate.The worst part of having an illness like CFS — besides the terrible symptoms, missing out on life, and the indignity of people doubting that I was really sick — was the crazy-making, full-time job that was searching for ways to get better. Through some painful on-the-job training, I developed the following seven habits that eventually enabled me to manage my symptoms and get back on the path to fuller health.Before I continue, it’s important to acknowledge that CFS is a broad diagnosis, and that people who have it will reach varied levels of wellness. I was fortunate enough to fully regain my health, and have seen many others do the same. Everyone has their own path to health, and whatever your potential is, I hope these suggestions can help you find yours.1. Take ChargeMake sure you recognize that you are responsible for your own healing, and that your healthcare providers are your expert consultants.After years of hoping to find the doctor with the cure, I realized that I needed to change my approach. I came into every appointment with a friend to advocate for me, along with a list of questions, a chart of my symptoms, and research on treatments. I got third opinions, and refused any treatment if the provider couldn’t produce two patients for whom it had worked, and who were still healthy one year later.2. Experiment PersistentlyBe open to big changes, and question your assumptions.During the early years of my illness, I experimented with my diet a great deal. I cut out wheat, dairy, and sugar. I tried an anti-Candida cleanse, being vegan, a six-week Ayurvedic cleanse, and more. When none of those helped, I concluded that while eating healthy helped a bit, food couldn’t heal me. I was wrong. I was only able to recover my health when I questioned that conclusion.After five years of illness, I took on a strict, raw vegan diet that I had ruled out as too extreme four years before. Within 12 months, I was feeling better.3. Nurture Your HeartEstablish a daily practice that can help you manage the hard emotions that might sabotage your healing efforts, like journaling, peer counseling, or meditation.I was part of a peer counseling community, and had daily structured, two-way listening and sharing sessions with other counselors. These lasted anywhere from five to 50 minutes.These sessions enabled me to stay on top of the grief, fear, and anger that might have otherwise led me to give up or feel unable to make the big diet and lifestyle changes I needed to make.4. BelieveAdopt a fiercely confident attitude about yourself and your ability to get healthy.When the person leading a mind-body class I was in scolded me that my cynical attitude “wasn’t serving” me, I decided to become more optimistic. I started to look at treatments that didn’t work as useful data, not signs that I would never recover. Exercises like writing a termination letter to the anxious critic in my head helped me build my optimism muscles.Learn More About CFS5. Create Healing SpacesUse organizing principles to set up your home in a way that supports your healing.Practicing qi gong every day was an important part of my healing, but I had been a chronic qi gong procrastinator until I cleared out half of our family room to create a lovely practice space, with all the equipment I needed — a timer, CD, and CD player — in a nearby closet.6. Organize Your Medical InformationHaving a handle on your medical information will make you a more powerful advocate for yourself.I am a congenitally disorganized person. So, after years of papers flying all over the place, a friend helped me create a physical notebook, with tabs for “Articles,” “Notes from Medical Appointments,” “Medical History,” “Current Medications,” and “Lab Results.”I had all of my lab results sent to me, and I alphabetized them with tabs, like “Lupus,” “Lyme,” “Parvovirus,” and “Parasites.” That made every appointment more productive for me and my providers. 7. Be OpenTalk with your friends and family openly, and invite them to support you in your healing journey.After five years of illness, I finally got over my delusion that I didn’t need help. Once people began coming with me to appointments, spending time researching options with me, and coming to visit, I had the confidence to take on the strict healing diet that had felt too difficult before. Nachman of Breslov, an 18th century Hassidic rabbi from Ukraine, famously said that “a little bit is also good.” Wherever you are in your healing, taking steps to strengthen even one aspect of your journey can make a real difference in moving you toward a healthier future.Share on PinterestLearn more about Janette at HealforRealNow.com or connect with her on Twitter @JanetteH_J.

106,"A new study shows abnormal immune proteins in the spinal fluid of people with chronic fatigue syndrome.Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia were both met with skepticism from doctors in the past. But as fibromyalgia has gained mainstream acceptance, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), has continued to meet with confusion and disbelief.That researchers can’t agree on a name for CFS shows just how little is known about a condition that affects at least 1 million Americans. Doctors don’t know what causes the chronic exhaustion and cognitive impairment of CFS. The only medical treatments are antidepressants and sleeping pills. Learn More About Chronic Fatigue Syndrome » Dr. Mady Hornig, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and her colleagues at the Chronic Fatigue Initiative are pushing hard to show that CFS is a real physical ailment.Last month, Hornig published a paper that found a unique immune signature in the blood of CFS patients. That paper claimed to be the first to offer proof that CFS is a “biological illness.”“The more that we can demonstrate with objective evidence that there’s something biologically different in the blood and in the brain in individuals with ME/CFS, the more advances we can make toward upending that entrenched and mistaken view of the illness,” Hornig told Healthline.In a second paper published today, Hornig and her colleagues showed differences in the number of immune molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy patients and those with CFS. That fluid “gives kind of a window to what’s going on in the brain,” explained Suzanne Vernon, Ph.D., the scientific director of the Solve ME/CFS Initiative.An immune response in the brain could explain the cognitive impairment CFS patients call “brain fog.” Related News: Cognitive Symptoms of MS Are Worse in the Summer » What Is ‘Brain Fog’?Patients who are experiencing severe symptoms of CFS, which tend to ebb and flow, complain they have difficulty retrieving memories. Some even find themselves unable to sign their own names, Hornig said.CFS-sufferers don’t forget so much as have difficulty calling up their memories.“It’s the effort that they require to process things that you need to do even simple tasks,” Hornig said. Patients often describe this “brain fog” as the single worse symptom of CFS.Hornig’s new study compared snapshots of immune molecules called cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid of long-time chronic fatigue patients to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to a healthy control group.Many of the cytokines were less common in the CFS group, most notably interleukin 6. In animal research, scientists have shown that the brain needs interleukin 6 in order to form memories. CFS and MS patients did have higher levels of one cytokine — eotaxin — than the healthy volunteers. Related News: Science Finds ‘Robust’ Evidence Chronic Fatigue Is a Physical Illness » A picture is emerging of CFS as an autoimmune disease that, like MS, has both physical and neurological symptoms.“This work further substantiates the reality of this profound pathology that’s happening in ME/CFS patients,” Vernon said. Immune Disturbance Is a Clue, Not an AnswerWith some cytokines at lower levels and a few at higher levels, the study results “indicate a markedly disturbed immune signature” akin to patterns seen in cases of autoimmunity, the study authors concluded.But a “disturbed” immune processes isn’t specific enough to pinpoint the cause of the condition. It could be a virus or an allergy that sends the immune system off course, according to Hornig.There’s still work to be done, in other words.“What we aim to do with this research is to fill up the empty toolkits of clinicians,” Hornig said. “There are no clear diagnostic tests, and there are no treatments in those toolkits either. We want to get some traction so that there isn’t a disincentive for physicians to diagnose this illness.” Learn More: Institute of Medicine Says ‘Chronic Fatigue’ Should Get a New Name » ",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/study-helps-explain-brain-fog-in-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-033115,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,Study Helps Explain ‘Brain Fog’ in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
107,"Part of living with CFS is wrestling with the appeal of stimulants — prescribed and not. Guido Mieth / Getty ImagesIt’s 1:00 a.m. on a work night. There are 2 hours to close, 3 hours until clean up’s done. If you choose to brave the kebab shop queues on your way home, the total work-to-bed pipeline will be no less than 4 hours. The next day, you wake up plastered to your pillows. You watch the clock turn from 2:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m., jumping to 7:00 p.m., before inexplicably reading 9:30. You try to get up, but your joints creak, and your brain drops into your belly. When you attempt to form a sentence, it comes out curly and incomprehensible. You lie back down, shirking phone calls and gathering an army of unread text messages. All of your friends and enemies are out drinking, dancing, and harnessing their youth. If you manage to get out of bed, you can join them. The hard part is just getting up. It started with self-medicating As someone whose FOMO is more clinical than their chronic fatigue, I couldn’t go on spending my days like Grandpa Joe in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” Missed night out after missed night out, my resentment for my tiredness grew. Then, I found my golden ticket. Cocaine wasn’t entirely off my radar. But it wasn’t something I ever committed to until I decided it could be a performance-enhancing tool. I was stuck in Scotland, where prescribed Adderall is more or less unheard of. Coke seemed like a reasonable route to energy and endurance — a way to cope. And so I began. On days I felt exhausted, I would arrange several lines around a matcha latte and resurrect myself with a stimulant seance. I thought I had my chronic fatigue in remission. All of a sudden, I could keep up with all the other 20-somethings. I got myself out of the bath and to the bar (for more than 2 hours!). I broke up with the couch, ghosted DoorDash, and finally washed my pajama pants. Work and play –– for the first time ever, I had it all. I became a delusional crusader of health and wellness. Doing yoga, going for long walks, and sipping my oat milk-turmeric blends, I felt like I had elevated to a higher plane and had no problem preaching it to my friends. I turned my nose up at the smokers heading outside for their smoke breaks, while I was escaping every hour on the hour for a coke break.“No, I can’t have coffee. It’s not good for my condition,” I would say. “You’re literally on cocaine,” they would counter. What is chronic fatigue syndrome, anyway? Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is an elusive and difficult to diagnose disorder characterized by unrelenting tiredness. People with CFS experience extreme fatigue following mental and physical activities. Brain fog, memory issues, joint pain, and sore throat are also common symptoms. CFS can co-occur with mental health disorders, autoimmune diseases, and sleep disorders. Because of this, treatment for one of the above may offer relief.But, for some, there’s no long-term recovery. Instead, they’re left to do the impossible: strike the perfect subjective balance between activity and rest. Can stimulants really be a ‘fix’ for CFS?Some doctors prescribe stimulants, like Adderall, Vyvanse, and Ritalin — all commonly used to manage symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — to people with CFS who don’t respond to other treatments or who experience symptoms of both CFS and ADHD.But how well do these actually work? Does the research around them back up my personal use of a stimulant (albeit, a non-legal one) to manage CFS?A 2014 study, expanding on a 2006 trial, suggests Ritalin may help to relieve fatigue and improve cognitive function for people with CFS. A small, older 2003 study suggests Dexedrine, another stimulant prescribed for ADHD, might have similar effects for people with CFS. Sounds like an easy fix, right? Not necessarily. Before considering stimulants for chronic fatigue, think about the nature of your symptoms. If you experience insomnia or sleeplessness, for example, stimulants might only serve to make things worse.Even for people with CFS who don’t experience sleep disorders, ADHD meds (or, if you’re like me, cocaine) may feel like the answer in the early hours. But they’ll catch up with you. Facing the consequencesAfter several weeks of consistently using cocaine, I crashed — hard. It doesn’t matter if you buy your energy boost in a trendy café or skulk for it in a dark alley –– all stimulants work by, well, stimulating your central nervous system. This results in an increase of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. But as the stimulant wears off and neurotransmitters return to their previous levels, you might be left with even worse fatigue (not to mention irritability).A number of people in the CFS community also report experiencing high blood pressure, dizziness, digestive issues, and insomnia after using stimulants. Some attribute these symptoms to adrenal fatigue, a condition most medical experts don’t recognize. Regardless of the underlying process that causes them, these symptoms won’t do you any favors if you’re dealing with CFS. With such inability to sleep, you can easily find yourself putting a bandage over your health issues, suspended in an endless cycle of Ambien and Adderall. If your doctor has prescribed you Ritalin or Adderall, use it as intended, and try to avoid the temptation of believing more is always better. Are there any alternatives? The advice “take rest” can be, um, annoying. In this work-first world, some people wear overexertion and burnout like a badge. What’s more, not all of us can afford to find a new job with fewer demands and stay afloat –– especially when fronting bills to see endocrinologists and other specialty doctors. It’s no secret that we live in a stimulant-dependent society. We’re expected to do the most, even when we’re feeling the worst. “Take rest” can be an impossible ask on top of an already impossible condition.So, are there any other ways to augment energy levels without risking addiction or adrenal insufficiency? Some people swear by natural nootropics or medicinal mushrooms, like cordyceps and lion’s mane, for beating brain fog and other symptoms. But research around these approaches is limited, and healthcare professionals aren’t always open to discussing them. That said, there’s some research to suggest that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) are safe to take long-term, and they may reduce fatigue in people with CFS. I still don’t have the answersI’ve had sleep issues since I was 12 years old, before I even had my first drink (unless you count the 0.2 ounces of vodka and orange Gatorade I’d mix myself after school before watching “The Real World”). Growing up, I never had any stimulants prescribed to me, I kept away from cups of Kona coffee, and I was even light on the sugar. But insomnia still manifested.Eventually, it became something I would use to justify my exhaustion, my rage, my propensity to addiction. The worst part is: It still haunts me, even when I do everything right. Unfortunately, even if you lighten your workload and perform self-massage every night, managing chronic fatigue is a life-long process for many people.The bottom line There’s no flowery or pretty takeaway from all of this.You may have to accept that your days of being able to go from the gym, to work, to the grocery store, to a friend’s place, across state lines, then back home for a nightcap are over. Or your doctor might prescribe you a stimulant that rebirths you and doesn’t make you curious about any of the stronger stuff.Everyone is different. I still get tempted to give myself an illegal boost around significant events, like weddings, holidays, and bachelorette parties. (Who wants to be on a party boat with Grandpa Joe?) Occasionally, I give in –– and I forgive myself. Lastly, remember: Tired people can party, too –– we just pay a higher cost. Kiki Dy is a copywriter, essayist, and yoga instructor.

108," How are depression and fatigue linked?Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are two conditions that can make someone feel extremely tired, even after a good night’s rest. It’s possible to have both conditions at the same time. It’s also easy to mistake feelings of fatigue for depression and vice-versa. Depression occurs when a person feels sad, anxious, or hopeless for an extended period of time. People who are depressed often have sleep problems. They may sleep too much or not sleep at all. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a condition that causes a person to have continuous feelings of fatigue without any underlying cause. Sometimes chronic fatigue syndrome is misdiagnosed as depression.  What are the differences between depression and fatigue?The main difference between these conditions is that chronic fatigue syndrome is primarily a physical disorder while depression is a mental health disorder. There can be some overlap between the two. Symptoms of depression can include:continuous feelings of sadness, anxiety, or emptinessfeelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or worthlessnessdisinterest in hobbies you once enjoyedeating too much or too littletrouble concentrating and making decisions Physical symptoms can also occur with depression. People may have frequent:headachescrampsstomach upsetother painsThey may also have trouble going to sleep or sleeping through the night, which can lead to exhaustion. People with chronic fatigue syndrome often have physical symptoms that aren’t commonly associated with depression. These include: joint pain tender lymph nodes muscle pain sore throat Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome also affect people differently when it comes to their daily activities. People with depression often feel very tired and aren’t interested in doing any activity, regardless of the task or the required amount of effort. Meanwhile, those with chronic fatigue syndrome usually want to engage in activities but just feel too tired to do so. To diagnose either condition, your doctor will try to rule out other disorders that can cause similar symptoms. If your doctor thinks you have depression, they may refer you to a mental health expert for evaluation.  An unfortunate connectionUnfortunately, people who have chronic fatigue syndrome may become depressed. And while depression doesn’t cause chronic fatigue syndrome, it can certainly cause increased fatigue. Many people with chronic fatigue syndrome have sleep disorders, such as insomnia or sleep apnea. These conditions often make fatigue worse because they prevent people from getting a good night’s rest. When people feel tired, they may not have the motivation or energy to do their daily activities. Even walking to the mailbox can feel like a marathon. The lack of desire to do anything can put them at risk for developing depression. Fatigue may also fuel depression. People with depression often feel very tired and don’t want to take part in any activities.  Diagnosing depression and fatigueTo make a depression diagnosis, your doctor will ask you about your medical history and give you a questionnaire that assesses depression. They may use other methods, such as blood tests or X-rays, to make sure another disorder isn’t causing your symptoms. Before diagnosing you with chronic fatigue syndrome, your doctor will run several tests to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These may include restless leg syndrome, diabetes, or depression. Treating depression and fatigueTherapy or counseling can help treat depression. It can also be treated with certain medications. These include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers. Taking antidepressants can sometimes make symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome worse. That’s why your doctor should screen you for depression and chronic fatigue syndrome before prescribing any medication. Several treatments can help people with chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, or both. These include: deep-breathing exercisesmassagestretchingtai chi (a slow-moving type of martial arts)yogaPeople with depression and chronic fatigue syndrome should also try to develop good sleeping habits. Taking the following steps can help you sleep longer and more deeply:go to bed at the same time every nightcreate an environment that promotes sleep (such as a dark, silent, or cool room)avoid taking long naps (limit them to 20 minutes)avoid foods and drinks that can prevent you from sleeping well (such as caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco)avoid exercising at least 4 hours before bedtimeOnline therapy optionsRead our review of the best online therapy options to find the right fit for you. When to see your doctorTalk to your doctor if you’re struggling with prolonged fatigue or think you have depression. Both chronic fatigue syndrome and depression cause changes that can negatively affect your personal and work life. The good news is that both conditions can improve with the right treatment.

109,"What is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.What causes chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?The cause of CFS is unknown. There may be more than one thing that causes it. It is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.Who is at risk for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?Anyone can get CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women have it more often that adult men. Whites are more likely than other races to get a diagnosis of CFS, but many people with CFS have not been diagnosed with it.What are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?CFS symptoms can include:Severe fatigue that is not improved by restSleep problemsPost-exertional malaise (PEM), where your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activityProblems with thinking and concentratingPainDizzinessCFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time - sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.How is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) diagnosed?CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS. He or she will do a thorough medical exam, including:Asking about your medical history and your family's medical historyAsking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Your doctor will want to know how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.A thorough physical and mental status examBlood, urine, or other testsWhat are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)?There is no cure or approved treatment for CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your health care provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not ""push and crash."" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.Since the process of developing a treatment plan and attending to self-care can be hard if you have CFS, it is important to have support from family members and friends.Don't try any new treatments without talking to your health care provider. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",https://medlineplus.gov/chronicfatiguesyndrome.html,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,MedLine Plus: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
110,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a long-term illness that affects many body systems. People with this illness are not able to do their usual activities. Sometimes, they may be confined to bed. The condition can also be called systemic exertional intolerance disease (SEID).One common symptom is severe fatigue. It does not get better with rest and is not directly caused by other medical problems. Other symptoms can include problems with thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness.CausesThe exact cause of ME/CFS is unknown. It may have more than one cause. For example, two or more possible causes may work together to trigger the illness.Researchers are looking into these possible causes:Infection -- About 1 out of 10 people who develop certain infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Q fever, go on to develop ME/CFS. Other infections have also been studied, but no one cause has been found.Immune system changes -- ME/CFS may be triggered by changes in the way a person's immune system responds to stress or illness.Mental or physical stress -- Many people with ME/CFS have been under serious mental or physical stress before becoming ill.Energy production -- The way that cells within the body get energy is different in people with ME/CFS than in people without the condition. It's unclear how this is linked to developing the illness. Long COVID or Post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC) -- Some people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus continue to have symptoms weeks or months later. This is called long COVID. Because symptoms such as extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and sleep problems are similar to ME/CFS, researchers are looking into a possible connection between the two conditions.Genetics or environmental factors may also play a role in the development of ME/CFS:Anyone can get ME/CFS.While most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages.Among adults, women are affected more often than men.White people are diagnosed more than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, particularly among minorities. SymptomsThere are three main, or ""core,"" symptoms in people with ME/CFS:Profound fatigueWorsening symptoms after physical or mental activitySleep problemsPeople with ME/CFS have persistent and profound fatigue and are unable to do activities they were able to do before the illness. This extreme fatigue is:NewLasts at least 6 monthsNot due to unusual or intense activityNot relieved by sleep or bed restSevere enough to keep you from participating in certain activitiesME/CFS symptoms can become worse after physical or mental activity. This is called post-exertional malaise (PEM), also known as a crash, relapse, or collapse.For example, you may experience a crash after shopping at the grocery store and need to take a nap before driving home. Or you may need someone to come pick you up.There is no way to predict what will cause a crash or know how long it will take to recover. It can take days, weeks, or longer to recover.Sleep issues may include problems falling or staying asleep. A full-night's rest does not relieve fatigue and other symptoms.People with ME/CFS also often experience at least one of the two following symptoms:Forgetfulness, concentration problems, problems following details (also called ""brain fog"")Worsening symptoms when standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. You may feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when standing or sitting up. You also may have vision changes or see spots.Other common symptoms include:Joint pain without swelling or redness, muscle aches, muscle weakness all over, or headaches that differ from those you have had in the pastSore throat, sore lymph nodes in the neck or under the arms, chills and night sweatsDigestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndromeAllergiesSensitivity to noise, food, odors, or chemicalsExams and TestsThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) describes ME/CFS as a distinct disorder with specific symptoms and physical signs. Diagnosis is based on ruling out other possible causes.Your health care provider will try to rule out other possible causes of fatigue, including:Drug dependenceImmune or autoimmune disordersInfectionsMuscle or nerve diseases (such as multiple sclerosis)Endocrine diseases (such as hypothyroidism)Other illnesses (such as heart, kidney, or liver diseases)Psychiatric or psychological illnesses, particularly depressionTumorsA diagnosis of ME/CFS must include:Absence of other causes of long-term (chronic) fatigueAt least four ME/CFS-specific symptomsExtreme, long-term fatigueThere are no specific tests to confirm the diagnosis of ME/CFS. However, there have been reports of people with ME/CFS having abnormal results on the following tests:Brain MRIWhite blood cell countTreatmentThere is currently no cure for ME/CFS. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms.Treatment includes a combination of the following:Sleep management techniquesMedicines to reduce pain, discomfort, and feverMedicines to treat anxiety (anti-anxiety drugs)Medicines to treat depression (antidepressant drugs)Healthy dietSome drugs can cause reactions or side effects that are worse than the original symptoms of the disease.People with ME/CFS are encouraged to maintain an active social life. Mild physical exercise may also be helpful. Your health care team will help you figure out how much activity you can do, and how to slowly increase your activity. Tips include:Avoid doing too much on days when you feel tiredBalance your time between activity, rest, and sleepBreak big tasks into smaller, more manageable onesSpread out your more challenging tasks throughout the week Relaxation and stress-reduction techniques can help manage chronic (long-term) pain and fatigue. They are not used as the primary treatment for ME/CFS. Relaxation techniques include:BiofeedbackDeep breathing exercisesHypnosisMassage therapyMeditationMuscle relaxation techniquesYoga It also may be helpful to work with a therapist to help you deal with your feelings and the impact of the illness on your life.Newer medicine approaches are being researched.Support GroupsSome people may benefit from taking part in an ME/CFS support group.Outlook (Prognosis)The long-term outlook for people with ME/CFS varies. It is hard to predict when symptoms first start. Some people completely recover after 6 months to a year.About 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are so severely disabled that they can't get out of bed or leave their home. Symptoms can come and go in cycles, and even when people feel better, they may experience a relapse triggered by exertion or an unknown cause. Some people never feel like they did before they developed ME/CFS. Studies suggest that you are more likely to get better if you receive extensive rehabilitation.Possible ComplicationsComplications may include:DepressionInability to take part in work and social activities, which can lead to isolationSide effects from medicines or treatmentsWhen to Contact a Medical ProfessionalCall your provider if you have severe fatigue, with or without other symptoms of this disorder. Other more serious disorders can cause similar symptoms and should be ruled out.If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org.

111,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling and complex illness.People with ME/CFS are often not able to do their usual activities. At times, ME/CFS may confine them to bed. People with ME/CFS have overwhelming fatigue that is not improved by rest. ME/CFS may get worse after any activity, whether it’s physical or mental. This symptom is known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). Other symptoms can include problems with sleep, thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness. People with ME/CFS may not look ill. However,People with ME/CFS are not able to function the same way they did before they became ill.ME/CFS changes people’s ability to do daily tasks, like taking a shower or preparing a meal.ME/CFS often makes it hard to keep a job, go to school, and take part in family and social life.ME/CFS can last for years and sometimes leads to serious disability.At least one in four ME/CFS patients is bed- or house-bound for long periods during their illness.Anyone can get ME/CFS. While most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages. Among adults, women are affected more often than men. Whites are diagnosed more than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, especially among minorities.As noted in the IOM report:An estimated 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS.About 90 percent of people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed.ME/CFS costs the U.S. economy about $17 to $24 billion annually in medical bills and lost incomes.Some of the reasons that people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed include limited access to healthcare and a lack of education about ME/CFS among healthcare providers.Most medical schools in the United States do not have ME/CFS as part of their physician training.The illness is often misunderstood and might not be taken seriously by some healthcare providers.More education for doctors and nurses is urgently needed so they are prepared to provide timely diagnosis and appropriate care for patients.Researchers have not yet found what causes ME/CFS, and there are no specific laboratory tests to diagnose ME/CFS directly. Therefore, doctors need to consider the diagnosis of ME/CFS based on in-depth evaluation of a person’s symptoms and medical history. It is also important that doctors diagnose and treat any other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Even though there is no cure for ME/CFS, some symptoms can be treated or managed.",https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html,Chronic fatigue syndrome/Myalgic encephalomyelitis,CDC: What is ME/CFS?
112,"            Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a frequent and severe chronic disease drastically impairing life quality. The underlying pathomechanism is incompletely understood yet but there is convincing evidence that in at least a subset of patients ME/CFS has an autoimmune etiology. In this review, we will discuss current autoimmune aspects for ME/CFS. Immune dysregulation in ME/CFS has been frequently described including changes in cytokine profiles and immunoglobulin levels, T- and B-cell phenotype and a decrease of natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, autoantibodies against various antigens including neurotransmitter receptors have been recently identified in ME/CFS individuals by several groups. Consistently, clinical trials from Norway have shown that B-cell depletion with rituximab results in clinical benefits in about half of ME/CFS patients. Furthermore, recent studies have provided evidence for severe metabolic disturbances presumably mediated by serum autoantibodies in ME/CFS. Therefore, further efforts are required to delineate the role of autoantibodies in the onset and pathomechanisms of ME/CFS in order to better understand and properly treat this disease.

113,"Cirrhosis is the severe scarring or fibrosis of the liver. It happens in the late stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and other conditions that involve liver damage.The scarring that occurs with cirrhosis is usually irreversible, but treatment can help manage it. Apart from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) other causes include hepatitis, long-term alcohol use, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), about 1 in 400 adults are living with cirrhosis in the United States. It’s more likely to affect men than women.Cirrhosis symptomsIllustrated by Jason HoffmanMany times, there aren’t noticeable symptoms of cirrhosis until the condition has progressed.Symptoms begin to occur because scarring on the liver has reached the point where the organ is limited in its ability to:purify the bloodbreak down toxinsproduce clotting proteinshelp with the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitaminsSome of the noticeable symptoms of cirrhosis include:decreased appetitefatigueunintentional weight lossmild pain on the upper right side of your abdomennausea vomitingenlarged or swollen veins (varices or varicose veins)More serious symptoms include:yellow discoloration of your skin and eyes (jaundice)confusion and difficulty thinking clearlybruising or bleeding easilyvery itchy skinurine that looks darker than usualabdominal swelling (ascites)swelling of your legs (edema)The stages of cirrhosisSymptoms of cirrhosis fall into two technical stages: compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis. If caught early enough and treated, it’s possible to reverse from the decompensated to compensated stage.Compensated cirrhosis. This is the asymptomatic (showing no symptoms) stage. There may still be scarring on the liver, but it has not progressed enough to cause many, or any, symptoms. Decompensated cirrhosis. This is the stage where most of the symptoms like jaundice or ascites occur. This is a very serious stage. In some situations, if you’re able to manage the reason cirrhosis started in the first place (e.g., heavy drinking), you may be able to reverse your diagnosis back to compensated.Common causes of cirrhosisThere are many different causes of liver cirrhosis. Two of the most common causes of cirrhosis in the United States are chronic hepatitis infections and chronic alcohol misuse.AlcoholAccording to a meta-analysis of studies from 2019, the risk of liver cirrhosis increases at any level of alcohol consumption for women, which means even a moderate drinker may be at some risk. For men, the risk of cirrhosis increases when an individual has more than one drink a day.However, every person is different, and enjoying a glass of wine with dinner most nights does not mean you’ll get cirrhosis of the liver. Usually, cirrhosis caused by alcohol is the result of regularly drinking in excess over the course of many years.There are also several other health factors that play into the development of this condition.Hepatitis Hepatitis C is a viral infection that can lead to inflammation and damage to the liver. Individuals who are at risk of getting this type of viral hepatitis include those who:use illegal injected drugsengage in sex without a condom or other barrier methodare on kidney dialysisHepatitis B is another viral form of hepatitis, but it tends to be less common in the United States and more common in:AsiaAfricaSouth AmericaEastern Europeparts of the Middle EastIf left untreated, both of these forms of hepatitis can cause cirrhosis of the liver.Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitisNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition that causes fat to build up in the liver, but it’s not associated with heavy alcohol use.Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of NAFLD, causes liver damage and inflammation in addition to fat buildup. If NASH is not managed, it can lead to cirrhosis.Other causesOther causes of cirrhosis include:Hepatitis D. Hepatitis D is often seen in people who already have hepatitis B.Autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis causes inflammation that can lead to cirrhosis.Damage to the bile ducts. These ducts function to drain bile. One example of a condition is primary biliary cholangitis.Disorders that affect the body’s ability to handle iron and copper. Two examples are hemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease.Medication. This includes prescription and over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen, some antibiotics, and some antidepressants.How cirrhosis is diagnosedA diagnosis of cirrhosis begins with a detailed history and physical exam. Your doctor will take a complete medical history.It’s important to be as honest as possible about long-term alcohol misuse, exposure to hepatitis C, family history of autoimmune diseases, or other risk factors.The physical exam will look for signs such as:skin or eyes that appear more yellowed in colorreddened palmshand tremorsan enlarged liver or spleendecreased alertnessTests can reveal how damaged the liver has become. Some of the tests used for evaluation of cirrhosis are:a complete blood count to look for anemiacoagulation blood tests to see how quickly blood clotsalbumin tests to check for a protein produced in the liverliver function testsalpha fetoprotein, a liver cancer screeningAdditional tests that can evaluate the liver include:an upper endoscopy to see if esophageal varices are presentan ultrasound scan of the liveran MRI of the abdomena CT scan of the abdomena liver biopsy, which is the most conclusive test for cirrhosisComplications from cirrhosisIf your blood is unable to pass through your liver, it creates a backup through other veins such as those in the esophagus. This backup is called esophageal varices.These veins are not built to handle high pressure and begin to bulge from the extra blood flow.Other complications from cirrhosis include:bacterial infections, like a urinary tract infection (UTI)bleeding due to decreased clotting proteinssensitivity to medications (the liver processes medications in the body)malnutritionkidney failureliver cancerhepatic encephalopathy, which is confusion due to the effects of blood toxins on the braingallstones (interference with bile flow can cause bile to harden and form stones)splenomegaly, which is an enlarged spleenTreatment for cirrhosisTreatment for cirrhosis varies based on what caused it, what symptoms you are experiencing, and how far the disorder has progressed. Treatments include medications, lifestyle changes, and surgery.MedicationsDepending on the cause of cirrhosis, your doctor may recommend certain medications, such as beta-blockers or nitrates (for portal hypertension). They may also recommend antibiotics or medications to treat hepatitis.Lifestyle changesIf your cirrhosis is a result of alcohol consumption, your doctor will most likely advise you to stop drinking.They may also recommend that you lose weight if they consider it medically necessary.If you are dealing with ascites, a low sodium diet may also be recommended. SurgeryIf cirrhosis has progressed to the point where treatment isn’t enough, one of the last options is a liver transplant.Preventing cirrhosisPracticing sex with a barrier method can reduce the risk of getting hepatitis B or C.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all infants and at-risk adults, such as healthcare professionals and rescue personnel, be vaccinated against hepatitis B.Limiting alcohol intake or avoiding alcohol, eating a balanced diet, and getting adequate exercise can help prevent or slow cirrhosis. Other prevention methods include:avoiding illegal drugstalking with your doctor about any medications you take and always taking the appropriate amountgetting screened for heptitis if you believe you may be at risk for itOutlookCirrhosis of the liver is a severe stage of liver disease and can be brought about in a variety of ways, such as from chronic misuse of alcohol, an unmanaged hepatitis infection, or untreated NAFLD.The liver is an important organ, and once it begins to scar due to liver disease, the damage can’t be reversed — only managed with treatment. If left untreated, the damage can become so severe that the liver can no longer function properly.While not every case of cirrhosis can be avoided, there are ways to prevent it.Pursuing a lifestyle that includes a nutritious diet, physical activity, moderate to limited alcohol intake, and regular physical appointments with a doctor are all ways to keep your liver in great shape.Read this article in Spanish.",https://www.healthline.com/health/cirrhosis#prevention,hepatic cirrhosis,Cirrhosis: Healthline
114," Hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosisSome 3.5 million people in the United States have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Yet most people infected with HCV don’t know they have it.Over years, HCV infection can cause major damage to the liver. For every 75 to 85 people who have chronic HCV infection, between 5 and 20 of them will develop cirrhosis. HCV infection is the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer. CirrhosisThe liver is an organ that detoxifies the blood and makes vital nutrients. There are many things that can damage the liver. Some of these include:chronic alcohol abuseparasiteshepatitisOver time, inflammation in the liver causes scarring and permanent damage (called cirrhosis). At the point of cirrhosis, the liver is unable to heal itself. Cirrhosis can lead to:end-stage liver diseaseliver cancerliver failureThere are two stages of cirrhosis:Compensated cirrhosis means the body still functions despite reduced liver function and scarring.Decompensated cirrhosis means that liver functions are breaking down. Serious symptoms may occur, like kidney failure, variceal hemorrhage, and hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatitis C can be invisibleThere may be few symptoms after initial HCV infection. Many people with hepatitis C don’t even know they have the life-threatening disease.HCV attacks the liver. Many people exposed develop a chronic infection after initial infection with HCV. Chronic HCV infection slowly causes inflammation and damage in the liver. Sometimes the condition may not be diagnosed for 20 or 30 years. Symptoms of cirrhosis due to hepatitis CYou may not have any symptoms of cirrhosis until there is considerable damage to your liver. When you experience symptoms, these may include:fatiguenausealoss of appetiteweight lossbleeding or bruising easilyitchy skinyellow discoloration in eyes and skin (jaundice)swelling in legsfluid in abdomen (ascites)abnormal blood tests, such as bilirubin, albumin, and coagulation parametersenlarged veins in the esophagus and upper stomach that may bleed (variceal hemorrhage)impaired mental function due to buildup of toxins (hepatic encephalopathy)infection of the abdominal lining and ascites (bacterial peritonitis)combined kidney and liver failure (hepatorenal syndrome)A liver biopsy will show scarring, which can confirm the presence of cirrhosis in people with HCV.Lab tests and a physical exam may be enough for your doctor to diagnose advanced liver disease without a biopsy. Progressing to cirrhosisLess than a quarter of people with HCV will develop cirrhosis. But, certain factors can increase your risk of cirrhosis, including:alcohol useinfection with HCV and another virus (such as HIV or hepatitis B)high levels of iron in the bloodAnyone with chronic HCV infection should avoid alcohol. Cirrhosis can also accelerate in people older than 45 as fibrosis and scarring increase. Aggressively treating HCV infection in younger people may help prevent progression to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis complicationsIt’s important to stay healthy if you have cirrhosis. Be sure to keep all immunizations up to date, including:hepatitis Bhepatitis AinfluenzapneumoniaCirrhosis can change the way blood flows through your body. Scarring may block blood flow through the liver.Blood might shunt through large vessels in the stomach and esophagus. These blood vessels can enlarge and rupture, causing bleeding into the stomach. Make sure to watch for abnormal bleeding.Liver cancer is another possible complication of cirrhosis. Your doctor may use ultrasound and certain blood tests every few months to test for cancer. Other complications of cirrhosis include:gingivitis (gum disease)diabeteschanges in how medications are processed in your body HCV and cirrhosis treatmentsHighly effective, direct-acting antivirals and other HCV medications can treat early-stage cirrhosis. These medications may slow the progression of liver disease and liver failure.When cirrhosis becomes advanced, treatment becomes more difficult due to complications like:ascitesanemiaencephalopathyThese complications can make it unsafe to use some medications. A liver transplant may be the only treatment option.A liver transplant is the only effective cure for advanced cirrhosis. Most people who receive a liver transplant for hepatitis C survive for at least five years after the transplant. But, HCV infection usually returns. It’s the most common cause of liver transplant in the United States. Cirrhosis outlookPeople with cirrhosis can live for decades, especially if it’s diagnosed early and managed well.About 5 to 20 percent of people with chronic hepatitis C will develop cirrhosis. With that in mind, it takes about 20 to 30 years for cirrhosis to develop in that population.Using direct-acting antivirals might help slow or prevent the progression to cirrhosis. If left untreated, cirrhosis can lead to liver failure.To preserve liver health, try the following:maintain general healthavoid alcoholget regular medical caretreat the underlying HCV infectionYou’ll also want to work with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to find the best treatment and monitor any complications.",https://www.healthline.com/health/cirrhosis-and-hepatitis-c,hepatic cirrhosis,"Cirrhosis and Hepatitis C: Their Connection, Prognosis, and More"
115,"Liver cirrhosis is a serious condition believed to affect more than 600,000 adults in the United States (1).If you, too, have received a diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, you’ve likely been told that the condition can’t be cured or reversed. Still, it may be comforting to know that following a cirrhosis diet may prevent further damage to your liver, protect against complications, and improve your quality of life both now and in the long term.This article covers the basics of a liver cirrhosis diet, including what it is, how it works, and whether it’s right for you.Stefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography/Getty ImagesAbout the dietLiver cirrhosis is a condition characterized by scarring of the liver. This can lead to impaired liver function and other side effects, including fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and nausea (2).Cirrhosis has several causes, including liver disease, hepatitis, heart failure, certain autoimmune disorders, and excessive alcohol consumption. It can also be caused by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a condition linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes (2).Thankfully, if you’ve received this diagnosis, following a liver cirrhosis diet can help you get the nutrients you need, protect against further liver damage, and prevent long-term complications (3, 4).Keep in mind that nutritional recommendations vary depending on several factors. While this article covers some basic guidelines for a liver cirrhosis diet, it’s best to work with your doctor or dietitian to find a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.summaryLiver cirrhosis is a condition characterized by scarring of the liver. Following a liver cirrhosis diet can help supply your body with the important nutrients it needs and prevent further damage to your liver.How to follow the dietIf you have liver cirrhosis, it’s important to get enough calories and high quality protein each day. This can help prevent malnutrition and preserve lean body mass — the part of your body that isn’t fat.The general recommendation is to eat 16–18 calories and 0.45–0.68 grams of protein per pound (0.45 kg) of body weight per day (5).For reference, this means that a person who weighs 150 pounds (68 kg) should consume 2,400–2,700 calories and 68–102 grams of protein per day.People with cirrhosis should prioritize high protein foods and incorporate both plant- and animal-based protein sources into their diet. Adding protein to every meal and snack can increase your overall protein intake and may help prevent muscle loss (5, 6). Still, more research is needed.When following a liver cirrhosis diet, aim to limit any foods and drinks that are difficult for the liver to process.In particular, limit your intake of foods high in unhealthy fats such as trans fats, including fried foods and processed snacks. Cirrhosis can impact your liver’s ability to produce bile, which is needed for the digestion of fats. Still, unprocessed fat sources like nuts, salmon, and avocados are fine to enjoy in moderation (3).You should also avoid alcohol, which can worsen liver damage and scarring. If you have trouble moderating your alcohol intake or struggle with alcohol dependence, don’t hesitate to talk with your doctor and ask for help (7).Because cirrhosis can impair your immune function, it’s also best to avoid raw or undercooked meat, eggs, and seafood. Otherwise, you run a higher risk of foodborne illness or infection (8).In some cases, your doctor may also advise that you limit your intake of sodium to prevent ascites. Ascites is a common complication of cirrhosis, characterized by abnormal fluid buildup in the abdomen (9).Because cirrhosis can increase your protein needs and impact your liver’s ability to store carbohydrates, eating several small protein- and carb-rich meals and snacks throughout the day may also be beneficial (5, 10).Lastly, certain vitamins or minerals may help manage your condition, since people with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk of deficiencies in nutrients such as zinc, vitamin D, vitamin K, and B vitamins (3).For specific supplement recommendations that suit your health and needs, talk with your doctor (3).summaryA liver cirrhosis diet should provide plenty of calories and high quality protein. You may also need to limit unhealthy fats, alcohol, raw meat and seafood, and high sodium foods.Foods to eat and avoidAlthough exact dietary recommendations vary depending on your health and needs, there are some general guidelines on which foods to eat and avoid when following a liver cirrhosis diet.Foods to eatA well-rounded liver cirrhosis diet should consist mostly of nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and legumes.Here are a few examples of foods to prioritize on a liver cirrhosis diet:Fruits: apples, oranges, berries, pears, peaches, plumsVegetables: broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, tomatoes, peas, potatoesProtein foods: eggs, dairy products, seafood, lean cuts of meat and poultryLegumes: beans, lentils, chickpeasNuts: walnuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, macadamiasSeeds: pumpkin seeds, flaxseed, chia seeds, hemp seedsWhole grains: quinoa, oats, brown rice, buckwheatHeart-healthy fats: olive oil, avocados, avocado oil, salmon, nuts, seedsBeverages: water, coffee, teaHerbs and spices: black pepper, cumin, dill, parsley, thymeFoods to avoidA liver cirrhosis diet should limit alcohol and foods high in unhealthy fats or sodium.Here are some foods to avoid on a liver cirrhosis diet:Highly processed foods: fast food, convenience meals, canned soups, packaged snacksUnhealthy fats: margarine, vegetable shortening, fried foodsSalty snacks: chips, crackers, pretzels, microwave popcornProcessed meats: hot dogs, sausage, deli meats, bacon, beef jerkyHigh sodium condiments: soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, steak sauce, spaghetti sauceUndercooked foods: raw or undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, fish, oysters, or musselsAlcohol: wine, beer, spirits, cocktailssummaryWhen on a liver cirrhosis diet, eat plenty of nutrient-dense, minimally processed ingredients like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Meanwhile, limit alcohol, processed foods, and ingredients high in sodium and unhealthy fats.Potential benefitsAlthough liver cirrhosis is not reversible, modifying your diet can help prevent complications.For example, limiting your intake of salty foods can promote sodium balance and prevent fluid retention and the associated condition ascites (11).Further, moderating your intake of unhealthy fats can protect against steatorrhea, or excess fat in the stool, which can be a sign of malabsorption in your gut (12).It’s important to focus on getting enough calories and consuming a variety of foods. This helps prevent malnutrition, which is a common complication of cirrhosis (13).Not only can malnutrition increase the incidence and severity of cirrhosis symptoms, but it can also impair immune function, decrease muscle mass, slow wound healing, and reduce your quality of life (13).Lastly, it’s important to get enough protein. Aim to consume plenty of high quality protein sources throughout the day, including foods like meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, and legumes (5).summaryFollowing a liver cirrhosis diet may prevent or improve certain complications and side effects of cirrhosis.Potential downsidesDepending on what your current diet looks like, transitioning to a liver cirrhosis diet may be somewhat difficult.For example, it can mean cutting down on foods and drinks you often eat and enjoy, such as packaged snacks, alcohol, or fast food. Further, the restrictions can make dining at restaurants or eating in social situations more challenging.It may feel disheartening that because liver scarring can’t be reversed, you may need to follow the diet long-term to prevent further damage. Therefore, it’s a good idea to talk with your doctor or a dietitian to learn how to put together a diet that you’re not just able to stick to long-term but also excited about. It’s important to work closely with a healthcare professional because liver cirrhosis is a complicated condition that may be accompanied by other conditions or complications. Together, you can ensure your diet plan meets your body’s needs. summaryA liver cirrhosis diet may be difficult to follow and usually needs to be followed long-term to prevent further liver damage. It also requires you to work closely with a healthcare professional to tailor your diet to your specific needs.Is it right for you?While a diet plan based on the details above can be a good starting point for those with liver problems, it’s important to also work with a healthcare professional.

116," What is decompensated cirrhosis?Decompensated cirrhosis is a term that doctors use to describe the complications of advanced liver disease. People with compensated cirrhosis often don’t have any symptoms because their liver is still properly functioning. As liver function decreases, it can become decompensated cirrhosis.People with decompensated cirrhosis are nearing end-stage liver failure and are usually candidates for a liver transplant.Read on to learn more about decompensated cirrhosis, including its symptoms and effects on life expectancy. What are the symptoms of decompensated cirrhosis?Cirrhosis usually doesn’t cause any symptoms in its earlier stages. But as it progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, it can cause:jaundicefatigueweight losseasy bleeding and bruisingbloated abdomen due to fluid accumulation (ascites)swollen legsconfusion, slurred speech, or drowsiness (hepatic encephalopathy) nausea and loss of appetitespider veinsredness on the palms of the handsshrinking testicles and breast growth in menunexplained itchiness What causes decompensated cirrhosis?Decompensated cirrhosis is an advanced stage of cirrhosis. Cirrhosis refers to scarring of the liver. Decompensated cirrhosis happens when this scarring becomes so severe that the liver can’t function properly.Anything that damages the liver can result in scarring, which could eventually turn into decompensated cirrhosis. The most common causes of cirrhosis are:long-term, heavy alcohol consumptionchronic hepatitis B or hepatitis Cbuildup of fat in the liverOther possible causes of cirrhosis include:buildup of ironcystic fibrosisbuildup of copper poorly formed bile ductsautoimmune diseases of the liverbile duct injuriesliver infectionstaking certain medications, such as methotrexate How is decompensated cirrhosis diagnosed?Generally, doctors will diagnose you with decompensated cirrhosis when you start having cirrhosis symptoms, such as jaundice or mental confusion. They’ll usually confirm the diagnosis by doing blood tests to determine liver function.They may also take a serum sample to come up with a model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. The MELD score is the most commonly used diagnostic tool for advanced liver disease. Scores range from 6 to 40.Doctors also sometimes do a liver biopsy, which involves taking a small sample of liver tissue and analyzing it. This will help them better understand how damaged your liver is.They may also use a series of imaging tests to look at the size and shape of your liver and spleen, such as:MRI scansultrasoundsCT scansmagnetic resonance elastography or transient elastography, which are imaging tests that detect hardening of the liver How is decompensated cirrhosis treated?There are limited treatment options for decompensated cirrhosis. At this later stage of liver disease, it’s usually not possible to reverse the condition. But this also means that people with decompensated cirrhosis are often good candidates for a liver transplant.If you have at least one symptom of decompensated cirrhosis and a MELD score of 15 or higher, a liver transplant is strongly recommended.Liver transplants are done with either a partial or whole liver from a donor. Liver tissue can regenerate, so someone can receive a portion of a liver from a live donor. Both the transplanted liver and the donor’s liver will regenerate within a few months.While a liver transplant is a promising option, it’s a major procedure with a lot of aspects to consider. In most cases, a doctor will refer a prospective patient to a transplant center, where a team of medical professionals will evaluate how well the patient would do with a transplant.They’ll look at:liver disease stagemedical historymental and emotional healthsupport system at homeability and willingness to follow postsurgery instructionslikelihood of surviving the surgeryTo evaluate all of this, doctors use a variety of tests and procedures, such as:physical examsmultiple blood testspsychological and social evaluationsdiagnostic tests to evaluate the health of your heart, lungs, and other organsimaging testsdrug and alcohol screeningHIV and hepatitis testsPeople with alcohol- or drug-related liver disease will likely need to demonstrate their sobriety. In some cases, this might involve showing documentation from an addiction treatment facility.Regardless of whether someone qualifies for a transplant, a doctor might also recommend the following to improve quality of life and avoid other complications:following a low-salt dietnot using recreational drugs or alcoholtaking diureticstaking antiviral medication to manage chronic hepatitis B or Climiting your fluid intaketaking antibiotics to treat any underlying infections or prevent new onestaking medications to help blood clottaking medications to improve the flow of blood to the liverundergoing a procedure to remove extra fluid from the abdomen How does it affect life expectancy?Decompensated cirrhosis can reduce your life expectancy. Generally, the higher your MELD score, the lower your chances are for surviving another three months.For example, if you have a MELD score of 15 or lower, you have a 95 percent chance of surviving for at least three more months. If you have a MELD score of 30, your three-month survival rate is 65 percent. This is why people with a higher MELD score are given priority on the organ donor list. Getting a liver transplant greatly increases life expectancy. While each case is different, many people return to their usual activities after a liver transplant. The five-year survival rate is about 75 percent.  The bottom lineDecompensated cirrhosis is an advanced form of cirrhosis that’s associated with liver failure. While there aren’t many treatment options for it, a liver transplant can have a big impact on life expectancy. If you’ve been diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis, talk to your doctor about your eligibility for a transplant. They can also refer to you to a hepatologist, which is a type of doctor who specializes in treating liver conditions.",https://www.healthline.com/health/decompensated-cirrhosis,hepatic cirrhosis,Decompensated Cirrhosis
117,"A new study reveals that states with stronger policies curbing alcohol consumption also had lower death rates for alcoholic cirrhosis.Over the years state legislators in the United States have passed a number of policies aimed at limiting the consumption of alcohol in an effort to reduce health and public safety issues. A new study suggests that these policies are working, at least when it comes to cirrhosis, the final stage of alcoholic liver disease.Researchers from Boston Children’s Hospital and other institutions found that states with tougher alcohol policies — such as taxes, restrictions on retail pricing, regulating the hours of sale, and limiting retail signage and media advertising — had lower death rates from alcohol-related cirrhosis. For every 10-point increase in the strength of a state’s policies as calculated on an Alcohol Policy Scale score, cirrhosis deaths dropped by 11 percent (the numbers did not include people of American Indian or Alaska Native descent).The bulk of the change was due to an 18 percent decrease in deaths among women, indicating that state alcohol policies may be more effectively targeting women than men.To put these policy differences in perspective, states were ranked on a scale of 1 to 100 for the strength of alcohol laws, with their scores ranging from 23 (weakest) to 66 (strongest) during the study period of 1999 to 2008.The findings were published online today in the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.Read More: What Is Alcoholic Liver Disease? »Binge Drinking and Cirrhosis Tied to PoliciesAfter alcohol reaches the bloodstream from the stomach or intestines, it is processed by the liver, which can handle about one drink per hour.Although the liver’s job is to break down the alcohol, this organ can also be damaged in the process, leading to inflammation, scarring, and cirrhosis. Previous research has shown that overall alcohol consumption in a region was closely tied to the number of deaths from alcohol-related cirrhosis.Among other things, state policies on alcohol sales and distribution are designed to reduce these types of health effects. Previous research shows that the policies can be effective.“This new study is consistent with a decades-long literature of hundreds of studies in its main finding,” Alexander Wagenaar, Ph.D., a professor of health outcomes and policy at the University of Florida College of Medicine, told Healthline. “Regulation of the distribution and sales of alcoholic beverages leads to lower rates of disease, injury, and death.”One key policy change was the raising of the drinking age from 18 to 21 by all states a few decades ago. This was followed by a decrease in teenage drinking, car crashes, and alcohol-related deaths.Alcohol taxes also affect consumption rates.”Hundreds of scientific analyses over the past half-century demonstrate that higher alcohol taxes lead to reductions in traffic crashes, cirrhosis disease, sexually transmitted infections, and many other alcohol-related causes of illness or death,” said Wagenaar.Most previous research, though, focused on the effect of changing a single alcohol policy on public health. The new study looked at the cumulative effects of all alcohol policies working together. Read More: What Is an Alcohol Overdose? »Policies Affect Some Groups DifferentlyUsing a similar method, two earlier studies in 2014 and 2015 found that stronger alcohol policies were tied to lower rates of binge drinking.Binge drinking is a risk factor for developing alcoholic cirrhosis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in six American adults binge drinks about four times a month, with about eight drinks per binge. In the new study, the researchers found that death rates from alcoholic cirrhosis among people of American Indian and Alaska Native descent weren’t affected as much by stronger state alcohol policies. The authors say this may indicate that state policies are not reaching these people, who often live in tribal areas not governed by state laws or in remote locations.In addition, the state policy rankings do not factor in federal or local policies, or how well state policies are enforced. This could explain some of the variation among states in the association between alcohol policies and death rates from alcoholic cirrhosis. While alcohol policies appear to be improving public health, the authors of the new study echo the call for further research.“Stronger alcohol policy environments are associated with lower alcoholic cirrhosis mortality rates,” they wrote in the paper. “Future studies should identify underlying reasons for racial/ethnic and regional differences in this relationship.”Read More: Drop in Teen Binge Drinking, but ‘Extreme’ Drinking Level Holds Steady »",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/tougher-alcohol-policies-lead-to-fewer-cirrhosis-deaths-101515,hepatic cirrhosis,Tougher Alcohol Policies Lead to Fewer Cirrhosis Deaths
118,"Women are drinking more, and they’re paying for it with their health.Drinking rates among women have risen in recent decades, and now they’re getting hit with related complications in higher numbers. These are the findings of a seven-year study published in the medical journal Hepatology. The study followed more than 100 million privately insured Americans.During the study period, alcohol-related cirrhosis rose 30 percent among men and 50 percent among women. The mean age at diagnosis was 53.5.Women are now receiving diagnoses of alcohol use-related disorders at twice the rate of men. The researchers also found that people with alcohol-related cirrhosis were disproportionately sicker at diagnosis. They were admitted and readmitted to the hospital more often. And their healthcare costs were almost twice those of people with nonalcoholic cirrhosis. “When I look at this data, it tells me that this is a big problem,” said Dr. Jessica Mellinger in a statement. Mellinger is a gastroenterologist and health services researcher at the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation.The problem may be much bigger than the study was able to capture.Study numbers only scratch the surfaceMellinger and her team conducted their study using the Truven MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database. This included only medical claims involving people aged 18 to 64 who had private insurance through an employer. The researchers didn’t use data from Medicare or Medicaid, as it didn’t include information on substance use. In the group that was studied, the rate of alcohol-related cirrhosis is even higher than some common cancers.Dr. Anton Bilchik is a professor of surgery and chief of gastrointestinal research at John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California.He believes the uninsured and underserved population may have an even higher incidence of cirrhosis.“We know there’s a higher incidence of cancer due to poor screening and more risk factors such as obesity,” explained Bilchik.Alcohol hits women harder than men“Women process alcohol differently than men, and they are more susceptible to damage in the liver than men,” said Mellinger. “They can develop cirrhosis with less alcohol and in a shorter time frame. The hypothesis is that certain hormones make women more susceptible, though we don’t know exactly why they are so much more susceptible,” Mellinger continued.Bilchik said the study is alarming.“What it suggests is that women need to be very cautious about the amount of alcohol they consume, given this increase in incidence,” said Bilchik. “We actually don’t know the exact reason.”Bilchik says that experts used to think female hormones like estrogen may protect against cirrhosis and certain cancers. “The fact that cirrhosis, which is a precursor to liver cancer, is increasing more rapidly in women than in men would suggest otherwise,” Bilchik said. Bilchik explains that he’s concerned there could be many women at risk for cirrhosis, but they may not know it until it’s too late. “By the time it’s detected by CAT [scan] or abnormal liver function tests, it’s usually quite advanced,” he said. “There are no early warning signs, and early damage to the liver is often not seen.” Additionally, he noted that alcohol consumption can raise the risk of other deadly cancers as well. “We just don’t know whether women are more susceptible to getting cancers such as pancreatic or stomach cancer related to alcohol compared with men,” Bilchik said. “It’s not been looked at in enough detail.” How much is too much?Bilchik says the high rates of cirrhosis diagnoses in women should make experts rethink guidelines around safe levels of alcohol consumption. “The moment women start consuming more than they should, they need to understand that there may well be damage going on in the body that’s not easy to detect,” he said. “And it can become irreversible.”Bilchik said that cirrhosis can develop after years of drinking. But many women may not know they’re causing permanent damage until it’s too late. “The only cure is a liver transplant. The best thing to do is avoid toxins that cause it in the first place,” Bilchik said of cirrhosis. “The problem is that many people are walking around with mild cirrhosis, which they don’t even know about.” Since other health conditions including hepatitis and obesity can damage the liver, Bilchik warns that women with multiple risk factors should be especially careful. “It’s safe for most women to have one or two glasses of wine a day. We’re referring to a few ounces, not a tumbler full,” he said. “Women shouldn’t fool themselves into thinking they’re not at risk when there’s half a bottle in each glass.” According to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015-2020, up to one drink per day for women and two per day for men is considered moderate. One drink is: 12 ounces of regular beer (5 percent alcohol)5 ounces of wine (12 percent alcohol)1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled spirits (40 percent alcohol)Mayra Mendez, PhD, LMFT, is a licensed psychotherapist and program coordinator for intellectual and developmental disabilities and mental health services at Providence Saint John’s Child and Family Development Center in California.Mendez told Healthline that people who think they “need” a drink to function or relax are probably drinking too much.“Anytime you’re pulling toward an external tool to feel better, you’re dependent,” she said. Another clue is that you’re in automatic mode rather than giving thought to what you’re drinking.Or if you spend your days thinking, “‘I can’t wait to get home to that glass of wine,’ it’s speaking to a bit of dependency,” Mendez said.Why are women drinking so much? Mendez said there are several reasons women may be drinking more.“Many women are in high-powered positions, having to juggle a lot of responsibility between family life, children, and partners,” she said.She also notes it’s become more socially acceptable for women to drink than in the past.“It’s not tainted with taboo anymore. When things are socially sanctioned and they become OK, we tend to do it with less thought to the consequences,” Mendez explained.Alcohol-related ads are increasingly targeting women. Drinking to excess is shown as a way to deal with stress and played for laughs in books, movies, television, and on social media.Mendez says drinking too much or excessive drinking destroys perspective and perception.“You become less thoughtful, maybe more irresponsible. We know for sure that medically, women metabolize alcohol at a much slower rate than men. It stays in the system longer and the impact of ‘mind fog’ is longer. Women get drunk quicker. That has a huge impact when it’s excessive,” Mendez said.Immeasurable cost to societyBilchik says the total expenses of alcohol-related cirrhosis are massive.The study found that in just the first year after diagnosis, nonalcohol-related cirrhosis costs $23,319 per person. In contrast, alcohol-related cirrhosis costs $44,835 per person.“The epidemics of obesity and alcoholism, all in all, are taking people away from the ability to work and function within their families and communities,” Bilchik said. “It’s much more cost-effective not to get into these situations in the first place.” Bilchik has another take-home message.“Pay very careful attention to lifestyle, diet, and nutrition at an early age,” he said.Seeking helpMendez says there’s nothing wrong with most people enjoying an alcoholic beverage. “But it’s a problem when you no longer have control and it has control over you.”When that happens, she advises seeking professional help.“There’s always the possibility that one recognizes they’re in a trap and can take action over it,” she said. “But the minute that self-initiative to take action isn’t followed through, you know you need additional help.” Mendez recommends seeing your primary care physician first and points out that reversing the habit may take the involvement of a psychotherapist.“Ask yourself: What are you really getting help about? Is it excessive drinking or is it really excessive stress and you’re using alcohol to manage stress?” Mendez said. “You can learn other coping tools to manage stress in a different way other than drinking.” ",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/alcohol-related-cirrhosis-in-women-spikes#Alcohol-hits-women-harder-than-men,hepatic cirrhosis,Alcohol-Related Cirrhosis in Women Spikes 50% in Less Than a Decade
119," Understanding cirrhosisCirrhosis of the liver is a late-stage consequence of liver disease. It causes scarring and damage to the liver. This scarring may eventually prevent the liver from functioning correctly, leading to liver failure. Many things can eventually lead to cirrhosis, including:chronic alcohol consumptionautoimmune hepatitischronic hepatitis Cinfectionsnonalcoholic fatty liver diseasepoorly formed bile ductscystic fibrosisCirrhosis is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time. Once you have cirrhosis, there’s no way to reverse it. Instead, treatment focuses on slowing down its progression. Depending on how severe it is, cirrhosis can have an effect on life expectancy. If you have cirrhosis, there are several tools your doctor can use to give you a better understanding of your outlook.  How is life expectancy determined?There are several ways to help determine the potential life expectancy of someone with cirrhosis. Two of the most popular ones are the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. CPT scoreDoctors use someone’s CPT score to determine whether they have class A, B, or C cirrhosis. Class A cirrhosis is mild and has the longest life expectancy. Class B cirrhosis is more moderate, while class C cirrhosis is severe. Learn more about the CPT score.MELD scoreThe MELD system helps to determine the risk of death in people with end-stage liver disease. It uses values from laboratory tests to create a MELD score. The measurements used to get a MELD score include bilirubin, serum sodium, and serum creatinine.MELD scores help to determine three-month mortality rate. This refers to someone’s likelihood of dying within three months. While this helps to give doctors a better idea of someone’s life expectancy, it also helps to prioritize those waiting for a liver transplant. For someone with cirrhosis, a liver transplant can add years to their life expectancy. The higher someone’s MELD score is, the more likely they are to die within three months. This can move them higher up the list of those waiting for a liver transplant.  What do the scores mean for life expectancy?When talking about life expectancy, it’s important to remember that it’s an estimate. There’s no way to know exactly how long someone with cirrhosis will live. But the CPT and MELD scores can help to give a general idea. CPT score chartScoreClassTwo-year survival rate5–6A85 percent7–9B60 percent10–15B35 percentMELD score chartScoreThree-month mortality riskLess than 91.9 percent10–196.0 percent20–2919.6 percent30–3952.6 percentGreater than 4071.3 percent Is there anything that can increase life expectancy?While there’s no way to reverse cirrhosis, there are several things you can do to try to help slow down its progression and avoid additional liver damage. These include:Avoiding alcohol. Even if your cirrhosis isn’t related to alcohol, it’s best to abstain because alcohol can damage your liver, especially if it’s already damaged.Limit salt. A cirrhotic liver has a hard time keeping fluid in the blood. Salt intake raises the risk of fluid overload. You don’t have to eliminate it from your diet completely, but try to stay away from processed foods and avoid adding too much salt while cooking.Reduce your risk of infection. It’s harder for a damaged liver to make proteins that help fight off infection. Wash your hands frequently and try to limit your contact with people who have any kind of active infection, from a common cold to the flu.Use over-the-counter drugs carefully. Your liver is the main processor of any chemicals or medications you consume. Make sure to tell your doctor about any over-the-counter medications, supplements, or herbs you use to make sure they aren’t putting a burden on your liver. How can I cope with a cirrhosis diagnosis?Being diagnosed with cirrhosis or being told you have severe cirrhosis can feel overwhelming. Plus, hearing that the condition isn’t reversible can send some people into a panic. If you’re not sure what to do next, consider these steps:Join a support group. Hospitals and healthcare facilities often coordinate support groups for people with chronic conditions, including liver disease and cirrhosis. Ask your doctor’s office or local hospital’s education department if they have any group recommendations. You can also look for online support groups through the American Liver Foundation.See a specialist. If you are not already seeing one, make an appointment to see a hepatologist or gastroenterologist. These are doctors who specialize in treating liver disease and related conditions. They can offer a second opinion and give you more information about treatment plans that will work best for you. Focus on the present. This is easier said than done, regardless of whether or not you have a chronic health condition. But dwelling on your diagnosis or blaming yourself for it won’t change anything. Try to shift your attention toward what you can still do for your health and quality of life, whether that’s consuming less salt or spending more time with loved ones. “The First Year: Cirrhosis” is a guide for the newly diagnosed. This is a great option if you’re still learning about the condition and what your diagnosis means for your future. “The Comfort of Home for Chronic Liver Disease” is a guidebook for caregivers to people with advanced liver disease and cirrhosis. The bottom lineCirrhosis is a chronic condition that can shorten someone’s life expectancy. Doctors use several measurements to determine the outlook of someone with cirrhosis, but these only provide estimates. If you have cirrhosis, your doctor can give you a better idea of your outlook and what you can do to improve it.

120," What Is Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis?The liver is a large organ with an important job in your body. It filters the blood of toxins, breaks down proteins, and creates bile to help the body absorb fats. When a person drinks alcohol heavily over the course of decades, the body starts to replace the liver’s healthy tissue with scar tissue. Doctors call this condition alcoholic liver cirrhosis. As the disease progresses, and more of your healthy liver tissue is replaced with scar tissue, your liver will stop functioning properlyAccording to the American Liver Foundation, between 10 and 20 percent of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis. Alcoholic liver cirrhosis is the most advanced form of liver disease that’s related to drinking alcohol. The disease is part of a progression. It may start with fatty liver disease, then progress to alcoholic hepatitis, and then to alcoholic cirrhosis. However, it’s possible a person can develop alcoholic liver cirrhosis without ever having alcoholic hepatitis.  What Symptoms Are Associated With This Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis?Symptoms of alcoholic liver cirrhosis typically develop when a person is between the ages of 30 and 40. Your body will be able to compensate for your liver’s limited function in the early stages of the disease. As the disease progresses, symptoms will become more noticeable.The symptoms of alcoholic liver cirrhosis are similar to other alcohol-related liver disorders. Symptoms include:jaundiceportal hypertension, which increases blood pressure in the vein that travels through the liver skin itching (pruritus) What Causes Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis?Damage from repeated and excessive alcohol abuse leads to alcoholic liver cirrhosis. When the liver tissue starts to scar, the liver doesn’t work as well as it did before. As a result, the body can’t produce enough proteins or filter toxins out of the blood as it should. Cirrhosis of the liver can occur due to a variety of causes. However, alcoholic liver cirrhosis is directly related to alcohol intake.  Are There Groups of People Who Are More Likely to Get This Condition?The most significant risk factor for alcoholic liver disease is alcohol abuse. Typically, a person has drank heavily for at least eight years. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines heavy drinking as drinking five or more drinks in one day on at least five of the past 30 days.Women are also more at-risk for alcoholic liver disease. Women don’t have as many enzymes in their stomachs to break down alcohol particles. Because of this, more alcohol is able to reach the liver and make scar tissue. Alcoholic liver disease can also have some genetic factors. For example, some people are born with a deficiency in enzymes that help to eliminate alcohol. Obesity, a high-fat diet, and having hepatitis C can also increase a person’s likelihood they will have alcoholic liver disease.  How Would a Doctor Diagnose You with Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis?Doctors can diagnose alcoholic liver cirrhosis by first taking a medical history and discussing a person’s history of drinking. A doctor will also run some tests that can confirm a cirrhosis diagnosis. These results of these tests may show:anemia (low blood levels due to too little iron)high blood ammonia levelhigh blood sugar levelsleukocytosis (large amount of white blood cells)unhealthy liver tissue when a sample is removed from a biopsy and studied in a laboratoryliver enzyme blood tests that show the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is two times that of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) low blood magnesium levelslow blood potassium levelslow blood sodium levelsportal hypertensionDoctors will also try to rule out other conditions that may affect the liver to confirm that cirrhosis has developed.  What Complications Can Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis Cause?Alcoholic liver cirrhosis can cause serious complications. This is known as decompensated cirrhosis. Examples of these complications include:ascites, or a buildup of fluid in the stomachencephalopathy, or mental confusion internal bleeding, known as bleeding varicesjaundice, which makes the skin and eyes have a yellow tintThose with this the more severe form of cirrhosis often require a liver transplant to survive. According to the Cleveland Clinic, patients with decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis who receive a liver transplant have a five-year survival rate of 70 percent.  How Is Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis Treated?Doctors can reverse some forms of liver disease with treatment, but alcoholic liver cirrhosis usually can’t be reversed. However, your doctor can recommend treatments that may slow the disease’s progress and reduce your symptoms. The first step in treatment is to help the person stop drinking. Those with alcoholic liver cirrhosis are often so dependent on alcohol that they could experience severe health complications if they try to quit without being in the hospital. A doctor can recommend a hospital or treatment facility where a person can start the journey toward sobriety. Other treatments a doctor may use include:Medications: Other medications doctors may prescribe include corticosteroids, calcium channel blockers, insulin, antioxidant supplements, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe).Nutritional Counseling: Alcohol abuse can lead to malnutrition.Extra protein: Patients often require extra protein in certain forms to help reduce the likelihood for developing brain disease (encephalopathy).Liver Transplant: A person often must be sober for at least six months before they are considered a candidate for liver transplant.  Outlook on Alcoholic Liver CirrhosisYour outlook will depend on your overall health and whether you have developed any complications related to cirrhosis. This is true even when a person stops drinking.",https://www.healthline.com/health/alcoholic-liver-cirrhosis,hepatic cirrhosis,Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis
121,"A new study finds that two or more cups of coffee a day can reduce deaths caused by liver cirrhosis—by 66 percent. If you’ve ever wondered whether your morning cup, or two, of joe is doing your body more harm than good, you’ll be glad to know that a new study has found that drinking two or more cups of coffee every day may reduce your risk of death from liver cirrhosis by 66 percent.Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver that occurs due to injury or long-term disease. Scar tissue cannot do what healthy liver tissue does—make protein, help fight infections, clean the blood, help digest food, and store energy.A 2004 report from The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that each year 1.3 percent of total worldwide deaths are caused by liver cirrhosis. Previous research shows that 29 million Europeans have chronic liver disease, with 17,000 deaths annually attributed to cirrhosis. According to WHO, liver cirrhosis is the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S.The study, published in Hepatology, a journal published by Wiley on behalf of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, was conducted by Woon-Puay Koh of Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore and the National University of Singapore.Researchers found that consuming two or more cups of coffee each day reduces the risk of death from liver cirrhosis—specifically cirrhosis caused by non-viral hepatitis—by 66 percent.What Is Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis? »Coffee the Only Drink that Reduced Mortality RiskWhile the effects of alcohol, black tea, green tea, and soft drinks were also included in the study, coffee was found to be the only drink that decreased these risks.The study, called The Singapore Chinese Health Study, evaluated 63,275 Chinese people, aged 45 to 74 years old. Researchers obtained data on diet, lifestyle, and medical histories, via interviews and questionnaires that were conducted between 1993 and 1998. Subjects were followed up for an average of 15 years. During that time, 4,928 of the study participants died. The cause was liver cirrhosis in 114 participants. The mean age of death was 67 years.Learn More: 6 Benefits of a Cup of Coffee »Participants Who Drank Alcohol Daily Had Greater RiskNot surprisingly, participants in the study who drank at least 20 grams of ethanol (alcohol) each day had a greater risk of cirrhosis mortality, versus non-drinkers. Consuming coffee was associated with a lower risk of death from cirrhosis, especially for non-viral hepatitis related cirrhosis.In a press release, Koh stated that the study is the first to demonstrate a difference between the effects of coffee on non-viral and viral hepatitis-related cirrhosis mortality. “This finding resolves the seemingly conflicting results on the effect of coffee in Western and Asian-based studies of death from liver cirrhosis. Our finding suggests that while the benefit of coffee may be less apparent in the Asian population where chronic viral hepatitis B predominates currently, this is expected to change as the incidence of non-viral hepatitis related cirrhosis is expected to increase in these regions, accompanying the increasing affluence and westernizing lifestyles amongst their younger populations,” said Koh.Related News: Caffeine May Enhance Your Memory »",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/coffee-reduces-risk-of-death-from-cirrhosis-040314,hepatic cirrhosis,Two Cups of Coffee a Day Can Reduce the Risk of Death from Liver Cirrhosis
122,"Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver and poor liver function. It is the last stage of chronic liver disease.CausesCirrhosis is most often the end result of chronic liver damage caused by long-term (chronic) liver disease. Common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States are:Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection.Alcohol abuse.Buildup of fat in the liver that is NOT caused by drinking too much alcohol (called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). It is closely related to being overweight, having high blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, and high cholesterol. Less common causes of cirrhosis include:When immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them, called autoimmune hepatitis (AH)Bile duct disordersSome medicinesLiver diseases passed down in families SymptomsThere may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly, depending on how well the liver is working. Often, it is discovered by chance when an x-ray is done or blood is drawn for another reason.Early symptoms include: Fatigue and loss of energyPoor appetite and weight lossNausea or belly painSmall, red spider-like blood vessels on the skin As liver function worsens, symptoms may include: Fluid buildup in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites)Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (jaundice)Redness on the palms of the handsIn men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swellingEasy bruising and abnormal bleeding, most often from swollen veins in the digestive tractConfusion or problems thinkingPale or clay-colored stoolsBleeding from upper or lower intestinal tractExams and TestsYour health care provider will do a physical exam to look for:An enlarged liver or spleenExcess breast tissueSwollen abdomen, as a result of too much fluidReddened palmsRed spider-like blood vessels on the skinSmall testiclesWidened veins in the abdomen wallYellow eyes or skin (jaundice) You may have the following tests to measure liver function:Complete blood countProthrombin timeLiver function testsBlood albumin level Other tests to check for liver damage include:Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomenMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomenEndoscopy to check for abnormal veins in the esophagus or stomachUltrasound of the abdomenYou might need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.TreatmentLIFESTYLE CHANGESSome things you can do to help take care of your liver disease are: Drink no alcohol.Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt, fat, and simple carbohydrates.Get vaccinated for diseases such as influenza, hepatitis A and B, and pneumococcal pneumonia.Talk to your provider about all medicines you take, including herbs and supplements and over-the-counter medicines.Exercise.Control your underlying metabolic problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.MEDICINES FROM YOUR DOCTORWater pills (diuretics) to get rid of fluid build-upVitamin K or blood products to prevent excess bleedingMedicines for mental confusionAntibiotics for infections OTHER TREATMENTSEndoscopic treatments for enlarged veins in the esophagus (varices)Removal of fluid from the abdomen (paracentesis)Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to repair blood flow in the liver When cirrhosis progresses to end-stage liver disease, a liver transplant may be needed. Support GroupsYou can often ease the stress of illness by joining a liver disease support group whose members share common experiences and problems.Outlook (Prognosis)Cirrhosis is caused by scarring of the liver. In most cases, the liver cannot heal or return to normal function once damage is severe. Cirrhosis can lead to serious complications. Possible ComplicationsComplications may include:Bleeding disordersBuildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and infection of the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)Enlarged veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines that bleed easily (varices)Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension)Kidney failure (hepatorenal syndrome)Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)Mental confusion, change in the level of consciousness, or coma (hepatic encephalopathy) When to Contact a Medical ProfessionalContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cirrhosis.Get emergency medical help right away if you have:Abdominal or chest painAbdominal swelling or ascites that is new or suddenly becomes worseA fever (temperature greater than 101°F or 38.3°C)DiarrheaConfusion or a change in alertness, or it gets worseRectal bleeding, vomiting blood, or blood in the urineShortness of breathVomiting more than once a dayYellowing skin or eyes (jaundice) that is new or gets worse quickly PreventionDO NOT drink alcohol. Talk to your provider if you are worried about your drinking. Take steps to prevent getting hepatitis B or C or passing it to other people.Alternative NamesLiver cirrhosis; Chronic liver disease; End-stage liver disease; Liver failure - cirrhosis; Ascites - cirrhosisPatient InstructionsCirrhosis - dischargeImagesDigestive system organsDigestive systemLiver cirrhosis - CT scanReferencesGarcia-Tsao G.

124,"            Liver cirrhosis is one of the most prevalent chronic liver diseases worldwide. In addition to viral hepatitis, diseases such as steatohepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, sclerosing cholangitis and Wilson's disease can also lead to cirrhosis. Moreover, alcohol can cause cirrhosis on its own and exacerbate chronic liver disease of other causes. The treatment of cirrhosis can be divided into addressing the cause of cirrhosis and reversing liver fibrosis. To this date, there is still no clear consensus on the treatment of cirrhosis. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in potential treatments that modulate the gut microbiota and gut-liver axis for the treatment of cirrhosis. According to recent studies, modulation of the gut microbiome by probiotics ameliorates the progression of liver disease. The precise mechanism for relieving cirrhosis via gut microbial modulation has not been identified. This paper summarizes the role and effects of the gut microbiome in cirrhosis based on experimental and clinical studies on absorbable antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics. Moreover, it provides evidence of a relationship between the gut microbiome and liver fibrosis.    ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33379148/,hepatic cirrhosis,The Role of the Gut Microbiome in Liver Cirrhosis Treatment
125,"            In the past, liver cirrhosis was considered an irreversible phenomenon. However, many experimental data have provided evidence of the reversibility of liver fibrosis. Moreover, multiple clinical studies have also shown regression of fibrosis and reversal of cirrhosis on repeated biopsy samples. As various etiologies are associated with liver fibrosis via integrated signaling pathways, a comprehensive understanding of the pathobiology of hepatic fibrogenesis is critical for improving clinical outcomes. Hepatic stellate cells play a central role in hepatic fibrogenesis upon their activation from a quiescent state. Collagen and other extracellular material components from activated hepatic stellate cells are deposited on, and damage, the liver parenchyma and vascular structures. Hence, inactivation of hepatic stellate cells can lead to enhancement of fibrolytic activity and could be a potential target of antifibrotic therapy. In this regard, continued efforts have been made to develop better treatments for underlying liver diseases and antifibrotic agents in multiple clinical and therapeutic trials; the best results may be expected with the integration of such evidence. In this article, we present the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis, current experimental and clinical evidence of the reversibility of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, and new agents with therapeutic potential for liver fibrosis.

126,"            The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology revised the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for liver cirrhosis in 2015. Eighty-three clinical questions were selected, and a literature search was performed for the clinical questions with use of the MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases for the period between 1983 and June 2012. Manual searching of the latest important literature was added until August 2015. The guidelines were developed with use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. This digest version in English introduces selected clinical questions and statements related to the management of liver cirrhosis and its complications. Branched-chain amino acids relieve hypoalbuminemia and hepatic encephalopathy and improve quality of life. Nucleoside analogues and peginterferon plus ribavirin combination therapy improve the prognosis of patients with hepatitis B virus related liver cirrhosis and hepatitis C related compensated liver cirrhosis, respectively, although the latter therapy may be replaced by direct-acting antivirals. For liver cirrhosis caused by primary biliary cirrhosis and active autoimmune hepatitis, urosodeoxycholic acid and steroid are recommended, respectively. The most adequate modalities for the management of variceal bleeding are the endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal varices and the balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration following endoscopic obturation with cyanoacrylate for gastric varices. Beta-blockers are useful for primary prophylaxis of esophageal variceal bleeding. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan is a useful add-on therapy in careful diuretic therapy for ascites. Albumin infusion is useful for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory disturbance and renal failure. In addition to disaccharides, the nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin is useful for the management of encephalopathy. Anticoagulation therapy is proposed for patients with acute-onset or progressive portal vein thrombosis.

127,"            Liver fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide due to chronic viral hepatitis and, more recently, from fatty liver disease associated with obesity. Hepatic stellate cell activation represents a critical event in fibrosis because these cells become the primary source of extracellular matrix in liver upon injury. Use of cell-culture and animal models has expanded our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stellate cell activation and has shed new light on genetic regulation, the contribution of immune signaling, and the potential reversibility of the disease. As pathways of fibrogenesis are increasingly clarified, the key challenge will be translating new advances into the development of antifibrotic therapies for patients with chronic liver disease.

128,"Leukemia can refer to all cancers affecting the white blood cells. How the cancer spreads can depend on the type of leukemia and how aggressive it is.What is leukemia?Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. There are several broad categories of blood cells, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. Generally, leukemia refers to cancers of the WBCs. WBCs are a vital part of your immune system. They protect your body from invasion by: bacteriavirusesfungiabnormal cellsforeign substancesIn leukemia, the WBCs do not function like normal WBCs. They can also divide too quickly and eventually crowd out normal cells.WBCs are mostly produced in the bone marrow, but certain types of WBCs are also made in the: lymph nodesspleenthymus glandOnce formed, WBCs travel through your bloodstream and lymphatic vessels to fight infection in the body’s tissues.What are the symptoms of leukemia?The symptoms of leukemia may include:excessive sweating, especially at night (called “night sweats”)fatigue and weakness that do not go away with restunintentional weight lossbone pain and tendernesspainless, swollen lymph nodes (especially in the neck and armpits)enlarged liver or spleenred spots on the skin, called petechiaebleeding easily and bruising easilyfever or chillsfrequent infectionsLeukemia can also cause symptoms in organs that have been infiltrated or affected by the cancer cells. For example, if the cancer spreads to the central nervous system, it can cause: headachesnausea and vomitingconfusionloss of muscle controlseizuresHow the cancer spreads depends on the type of leukemia and how aggressive it is. Leukemia can also spread to other parts of your body, including the:lungsgastrointestinal tractheartkidneystesticlesThe types of leukemiaThe onset of leukemia can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (slow onset). In acute leukemia, cancer cells multiply quickly. In chronic leukemia, the disease progresses slowly and early symptoms may be very mild. Leukemia is also classified according to the type of cell that’s affected. Leukemia involving myeloid cells is called myeloid or myelogenous leukemia. Myeloid cells are immature blood cells that would normally become granulocytes or monocytes. Leukemia involving lymphocytes is called lymphocytic leukemia. There are four main types of leukemia:Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can occur in children and adults. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), about 20,000 new cases of AML are diagnosed each year in the United States. This is the most common form of leukemia. The 5-year survival rate for AML is 29.5 percent.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) occurs mostly in children. The NCI estimates about 6,000 new cases of ALL are diagnosed annually. The 5-year survival rate for ALL is 69.9 percent.Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) affects mostly adults. About 9,000 new cases of CML are diagnosed annually, according to the NCI. The 5-year survival rate for CML is 70.6 percent.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is most likely to affect people over age 55. It’s very rarely seen in children. According to the NCI, about 21,000 new cases of CLL are diagnosed annually. The 5-year survival rate for CLL is 87.2 percent.Hairy cell leukemia is a very rare subtype of CLL. Its name comes from the appearance of the cancerous lymphocytes under a microscope.CausesResearchers do not know what exactly causes leukemia. However, there are some risk factors for developing this cancer. Some of these risk factors include:previous chemotherapy or radiation for other types of cancersgenetic disorders like Down syndromeother blood cancer disordersrepeated exposure to the chemical benzene, which is found in cigarette smokeRisk factors for leukemiaThe causes of leukemia are not currently known. However, several factors that may increase your risk have been identified. These include:a family history of leukemiasmoking, which increases your risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML)genetic disorders such as Down syndromeblood disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, which is sometimes called “preleukemia”previous treatment for cancer with chemotherapy or radiationexposure to high levels of radiationexposure to chemicals such as benzeneTreating leukemiaLeukemia is usually treated by a hematologist-oncologist. These are doctors who specialize in blood disorders and cancer. The treatment depends on the type and stage of the cancer. It also depends on the patient’s overall health and other medical conditions.Some forms of leukemia grow slowly and do not need immediate treatment. However, treatment for leukemia usually involves one or more of the following: Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia, you may take either a single drug or a combination of different drugs.Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to damage leukemia cells and inhibit their growth. Radiation can be applied to a specific area or to your entire body.Stem cell transplantation. A stem cell transplant replaces diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow, either your own (called autologous transplantation) or from a donor (called allogeneic transplantation). This procedure is also called a bone marrow transplant.Biological or immune therapy. Biological or immune therapy uses treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack cancer cells.Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses medications that take advantage of vulnerabilities in cancer cells. For example, imatinib (Gleevec) is a targeted drug that’s commonly used against CML. Diagnosing leukemiaLeukemia may be suspected if you have concerning symptoms or certain risk factors. A doctor will begin by looking at your complete history and performing a physical examination. However, leukemia cannot be fully diagnosed by a physical exam. Instead, doctors will make a diagnosis using:blood testsbiopsiesimaging testsA diagnosis is typically confirmed using a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration. TestsThere are a number of different tests that can be used to diagnose leukemia. A complete blood count determines the numbers of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets in the blood. Looking at your blood under a microscope can also determine if the cells have an abnormal appearance.Tissue biopsiescan be taken from the bone marrow or lymph nodes to look for evidence of leukemia. These small samples can identify the type of leukemia and its growth rate. Biopsies of other organs, such as the liver and spleen, can show if the cancer has spread.StagingOnce leukemia is diagnosed, it will be staged. Staging finds out how much the cancer has spread and progressed, and it helps a doctor determine your outlook.AML and ALL are staged based on how cancer cells look under a microscope and the type of cells involved. ALL and CLL are staged based on the WBC count at the time of diagnosis. The presence of immature white blood cells, or myeloblasts, in the blood and bone marrow is also used to stage AML and CML.Assessing the progressionA number of other tests can be used to determine the progression of the disease:Flow cytometry examines the DNA of the cancer cells and determines their growth rate.Liver function tests show whether leukemia cells are affecting the liver.Lumbar puncture is performed by inserting a thin needle between the vertebrae of your lower back. This allows your doctor to collect spinal fluid and determine if the cancer has spread to the central nervous system.Imaging tests, such as X-rays, ultrasounds, and CT scans, help doctors look for any damage to other organs that’s caused by the leukemia.Long-term outlookThe long-term outlook for people who have leukemia depends on the type of cancer they have and their stage at diagnosis. The sooner leukemia is diagnosed and the faster it’s treated, the better your chance of recovery is. Some factors, like older age, past history of blood disorders, and chromosome mutations, can negatively affect the outlook.According to the NCI, the number of leukemia deaths has been falling on average 1.7 percent each year from 2009 to 2018. The 5-year survival rate (or percent of people surviving at least 5 years after receiving a diagnosis) was 65 percent from 2011 to 2017.However, it’s important to note that this figure includes people of all ages and with all forms of leukemia. It’s not predictive of the outcome for any one person. Work with your medical team to treat leukemia and find out your specific outlook. Remember that each person’s situation is different.Read this article in Spanish.",https://www.healthline.com/health/leukemia#symptoms,Leukemia,A Guide to Leukemia
129," What is leukemia?Leukemia is cancer of the blood cells. Blood cells and platelets are produced in the bone marrow. In leukemia, some new white blood cells (WBCs) fail to mature properly. These immature cells continue to reproduce at a rapid rate, crowding out healthy cells and producing a host of symptoms.Leukemia is the most common type of childhood cancer, affecting about 4,000 children a year in the United States. Symptoms of childhood leukemiaThe cause of childhood leukemia cannot be determined in most cases. The symptoms of leukemia can vary from one child to another. The symptoms of chronic leukemia generally develop slowly, but those of acute leukemia can appear suddenly. Some symptoms can be easy to confuse with those of common childhood diseases. Having some of these listed symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean your child has leukemia.The common symptoms of childhood leukemia include the following:Bruising and bleeding A child with leukemia may bleed more than expected after a minor injury or nosebleed. The child may also bruise easily. They may have small red spots on the skin, or petechiae, which occur due to tiny blood vessels that have bled. The blood’s ability to clot depends on healthy blood platelets. In a child with leukemia, a blood test will reveal an abnormally low platelet count.Stomachache and poor appetiteA child with leukemia may complain of a stomachache. This is because leukemia cells can accumulate in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, causing them to enlarge. In some cases, a doctor may be able to feel the enlarged abdominal organs. The child may also have a poor appetite or be unable to eat a normal amount of food. Weight loss is common. Trouble breathing Leukemic cells can clump around the thymus, which is a gland at the base of the neck. This can cause dyspnea, or difficulty breathing. Breathing trouble can also result from swollen lymph nodes in the chest that push up against the windpipe. A child with leukemia may cough or wheeze. Painful breathing is a medical emergency.Frequent infections WBCs are necessary to fight off infection, but the immature WBCs of leukemia are unable to perform that function properly. A child with leukemia may experience frequent or prolonged bouts of viral or bacterial infections. The symptoms include coughing, fever, and runny nose. These infections often show no improvement, even with the use of antibiotics or other treatment.Swelling Lymph nodes filter the blood, but leukemia cells sometimes collect in lymph nodes. This can cause swelling:under your child’s armsin their neckabove the collarbonein the groinMRI and CT scans may reveal swollen lymph nodes of the abdomen or inside of the chest.An enlarged thymus can press on a vein that transports blood from the arms and head to the heart. This pressure can cause blood to pool and lead to swelling of the face and arms. The head, arms, and upper chest may take on a bluish-red color. Other symptoms include a headache and dizziness.Bone and joint painThe body produces blood in the bone marrow. Leukemia causes blood cells to reproduce at an accelerated rate, leading to severe overcrowding of blood cells. This buildup of cells can lead to aches and pains of the bones and joints. Some children with leukemia may complain of lower back pain. Others may develop a limp due to pain in the legs. Anemia Red blood cells (RBCs) help to distribute oxygen throughout the body. Overcrowding makes it difficult to produce enough RBCs. This leads to a condition called anemia. The symptoms include fatigue, pale skin, and rapid breathing. Some children also report feeling weak or lightheaded.If your child has a reduction in blood flow to their brain, they may slur their speech. A blood test will show if your child has an abnormally low RBC count. Outlook for children with leukemiaHaving some of these symptoms doesn’t necessarily indicate the presence of leukemia. Several forms of childhood leukemia exist, and many factors impact the outlook. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can improve outcome. Talk to your child’s doctor if you’re concerned about any of the symptoms your child has developed. Survival rates for some forms of childhood leukemia have risen over time, and improvements in treatment point to a better outlook for children diagnosed today.",https://www.healthline.com/health/symptoms-leukemia-children,Leukemia,Common Symptoms of Leukemia in Children
130,"If you have leukemia and your damaged white blood cells outnumber healthy ones, you may develop skin symptoms, like rashes, bruising, and mouth sores.Pictures of leukemia rashes and bruisingLeukemia is a type of blood cancer that develops in your bone marrow — the place where blood cells are made. It causes your body to make a large number of abnormal white blood cells. White blood cells normally protect the body against infection. In leukemia, all those damaged white blood cells crowd out healthy blood cells. When this happens, skin symptoms can occur. In 2018, around 459,058 people were living with leukemia in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The rate of new diagnoses for leukemia in 2018 was 14.7 per 100,000 people. When categorized according to race and ethnicity, the rates were: 16.5 for non-Hispanic white people11.4 for Black (includes Hispanic) people11.4 for Hispanic (any race) people11.2 for American Indian/Alaska Native (includes Hispanic) people8.8 for Asian/Pacific Islander (includes Hispanic) peopleIn this article, find out more about the skin symptoms leukemia can cause.Leukemia skin symptomsCommon skin symptoms with leukemia include: petechiaeacute myeloid leukemia (AML) rashmouth sores and swollen gumsleukemia cutiseasy bruising and bleedingchanges in skin colorother skin infections due to a reduced immune responseTiny spots called petechiaeOne symptom that some people with leukemia might notice is tiny red spots on their skin. These pinpoints of blood are called petechiae. On fair and light skin tones, these may appear as red dots. On darker skin tones, they may be darker than the surrounding skin and less noticeable.Petechiae usually occur where blood is most likely to accumulate, such as in your: feetlegshandsarmsThe spots are caused by tiny broken blood vessels, called capillaries, under the skin. Normally, platelets, the disc-shaped cells in the blood, help your blood clot. But with leukemia, your body does not have enough platelets to seal off the broken blood vessels.Mouth sores and swollen gumsMouth sores are common with some types of leukemia. In fact, some researchers say newly appearing mouth ulcers and swollen gums may be an early sign of AML.These changes may happen because of low levels of white blood cells or anemia.Leukemia cutisLeukemia cutis refers to various signs that can occur when leukemia affects your skin. It may appear before, alongside, or after other leukemia symptoms, but experts say it is rare. It happens when leukemia cells travel to the skin.Symptoms may affect your face, trunk (torso), and extremities and include:papules (small raised bumps on skin) and nodules (lumps under the skin) that typically feel firm or rubberyplaques (thick patches)changes in skin colorulcers and blisters, in some casesBruisesA bruise develops when blood vessels under your skin are damaged. People with leukemia are more likely to bruise because their bodies don’t make enough platelets to plug bleeding blood vessels.Leukemia bruises look like any other kind of bruise, but there tend to be more of them than usual. Additionally, they may show up on unusual areas of your body, such as your back.Easy bleedingThe same lack of platelets that makes people bruise also leads to bleeding. People with leukemia may bleed more than they would expect even from a small injury, such as a tiny cut.They may also notice bleeding from areas where there is no injury, such as their gums or nose. Injuries often bleed more than normal, and the bleeding may be unusually hard to stop.Change in skin colorAlthough leukemia can leave dark-colored rashes or bruises on your body, it can also affect your skin color in other ways.People with leukemia who have fair skin tones may look pale because of anemia. If you have anemia and you have a darker skin tone, you may notice that the mucous membranes in your mouth, nose, or eyes look blueish or gray.Anemia is a condition in which your body has a low number of red blood cells. Without enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body, anemia can cause symptoms such as:fatigueweaknesslightheadednessshortness of breathWhat is AML rash? Find out about the different ways a rash can appear with AML.Other skin infections and problems associated with leukemiaIf you have leukemia, skin changes can also happen for other reasons, such as an infection or an allergic or sensitivity reaction, for example, to drugs.When your body cannot produce enough white blood cells, it may become easier for several common infections and other problems to develop. This is because your immune system finds it harder to stop them.Ringworm and other fungal infectionsLeukemia affects your immune system, and this can make it harder to build an immune response against fungal and other infections. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that these types of infections can affect people with leukemia in different ways and for different reasons, depending on the type of leukemia and treatment options.Some fungal infections can become life threatening. It is essential to follow your doctor’s instructions about how to prevent them and what to do if they happen. Fungal infections can include:Ringworm. This is a fungal infection, also called tinea, that can appear on your skin as a circular rash. It is often itchy. Nail infections. These can cause your nail to change color, crack, break, and fall off. It may be linked to a fungal infection on your skin.Candida. Candida is a fungus that lives on your skin and commonly occurs in the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina. It does not usually cause problems, but it can lead to a rash if your immune system is affected by leukemia.Many types of fungal infections can affect people with leukemia. It’s best to tell your doctor as soon as you notice any changes so they can help you manage them.FolliculitisFolliculitis is an infection that affects your hair follicles. It’s usually caused by bacteria, but it can be fungal or viral. If you have a weakened immune system, you may have a higher risk of contracting it.Depending on the cause, symptoms can include:pustules (small, fluid-filled bumps)itchingpapules or plaques, in some casesIt can affect the:scalp face neck shouldersVasculitisVasculitis is an inflammation of small blood vessels and capillaries. If you have leukemia or another condition that affects the immune system, you may have a higher risk of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.Symptoms include purple or darker areas on the skin, which may feel different to the touch than the surrounding skin. They can range from 1 millimeter to 1 centimeter in diameter.There may be:pustulesbullae, similar to blistersnodulescrusted ulcersThere may also be: a low grade fevera general feeling of being unwellbody painSkin ulceration can occur in some cases. If you notice these types of changes, it is best to speak with your doctor.Sweet syndromeThis condition can affect people with various conditions, including those with cancer or a weakened immune system. It can result from an infection or from cancer itself. It’s also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis.Symptoms include:changes in your skin colorplaquespapulesSkin changes often appear suddenly, and there may also be a fever. Symptoms may go away without treatment, but if you have a diagnosis of leukemia, it is best to ask your doctor’s advice as you may need treatment.Allergic reactions to treatmentSome drugs can cause skin rashes. Morbilliform drug eruption is a common immune reaction to prescription drugs. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of developing this type of rash.A rash may appear 1 to 2 weeks after starting a drug, but it can occur up to a week after finishing the medication. If you start taking the drug again, the rash may come back after 1 to 2 days.The reaction usually: involves papules or flat maculeschanges in your skin color that may become pale with pressure but regain their color on releasing the pressurestarts on your trunk and spreads to both sides of your body, on the limbs and neckSkin may become pink to red on any skin tone. The changes in color may be harder to see on darker skin, or the pink or red may be darker.In most cases, complications don’t arise, and the rash goes away after stopping the drug. But it’s important not to stop using any medication without first checking with your doctor.Chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other cancer treatments can also cause a rash, dry skin, and other skin changes. Before starting any new treatment, speak with your doctor about what to expect and when to ask for help.Other symptoms of leukemiaLeukemia has a variety of symptoms, which will depend on the type of leukemia you have. Many of these are caused by a lack of healthy blood cells. In addition to skin symptoms, the American Cancer Society (ACS) lists the following as common symptoms when a person has a low blood cell count:feeling unusually tired or weakfeeling dizzy or lightheadeddifficulty breathingfrequent infections, including fever and chillsheavy bleeding during menstruationfrequent or severe nosebleedsbleeding gumsweight and appetite lossnight sweatsLeukemia is not the only possible cause of many of these symptoms, but blood tests and other tests can help your doctor confirm or rule out a diagnosis.Acute lymphocytic leukemiaOther symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) include:abdominal swelling, as cancer cells build up in your liver and spleenlymph node swelling, appearing as lumps under your skin, for instance in your underarms, neck, or groinbone or joint paina range of other symptoms if leukemia spreads to other areas, such as the lungs or brainChronic myeloid leukemiaWith chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), symptoms tend to develop more slowly. They include:weakness and fatiguenight sweats and feverweight lossbone painswelling in your spleen, under the left side of your rib cagea feeling of fullness in your abdomen, even after eating just a little Childhood leukemiaSigns and symptoms specific to childhood leukemia, according to the ACS, include:weakness and tirednessfeeling colddizziness and lightheadednessdifficulty breathingchanges in skin color, for instance, darker skin may become duskier and light skin may appear palerWhen to see a doctorIf you have a diagnosis of leukemia, your doctor will tell you what to look out for and what to do if you see symptoms. If leukemia or your treatment has weakened your immune system, it’s best to seek medical advice as soon as any concerns arise. Your healthcare team can help you manage these symptoms.If you do not have leukemia, it’s worth remembering that rashes and skin changes can happen for many reasons. However, if other signs are causing concern, ask a doctor to check them out. Many skin changes improve with treatment, and it can be a good idea to rule out more serious causes.",https://www.healthline.com/health/pictures-leukemia-rashes-bruises,Leukemia,Understanding Rashes and Bruising in Leukemia
131," Is leukemia hereditary?Leukemia is a cancer of the body’s bone marrow, which is where your blood cells are made. It’s a genetic disease, but most cases aren’t thought to be hereditary. Instead, a variety of risk factors can make you more likely to get the disease. Some of these risk factors are in your control, others aren’t.Scientists think the various types of leukemia are caused by mutations in the DNA of your blood cells. These genetic mutations change the way the blood cells in your bone marrow reproduce. They can also prevent these blood cells from functioning properly. Eventually, the abnormal blood cells crowd out your healthy blood cells. They can block your bone marrow from producing more healthy cells.The mutations are genetic, but usually not hereditary. This means that while leukemia is caused by mutations in your genes, these genetic abnormalities aren’t often inherited from your family. This is called an acquired gene mutation.It’s not always known what causes these mutations. You may be genetically predisposed to developing leukemia, but lifestyle risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, can also make you more likely to develop leukemia. Other environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals and radiation, could also be behind the DNA abnormalities that can cause leukemia. What’s the difference between a genetic disease and a hereditary disease?These two terms aren’t interchangeable, although they both refer to diseases that are caused by mutations in your genes. Let’s take a closer look.Genetic diseaseA genetic disease isn’t always one that is passed down through your family. A genetic disease is any medical condition caused by a DNA abnormality, whether it’s inherited or acquired. This DNA abnormality is caused by a mutation in one gene or multiple genes.The mutations can take place during your lifetime as errors occur in cell production. They can also be caused by environmental factors. These environmental factors include exposure to radiation or certain chemicals.Hereditary diseaseA hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease in which the gene mutations are inherited from your family. The gene mutations are present in the egg or sperm and cause the disease to be passed from parents to their children. Some examples of hereditary diseases include hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, and muscular dystrophies. It’s rare for these types of hereditary diseases to suddenly appear in someone with no family history of them.There are some types of hereditary cancers, as well. For example, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and prostate cancers have hereditary elements that may put families at risk. What are the genetic and environmental risk factors for leukemia?Understanding riskA risk factor is some element about you, your genetics, or your environment that can make you more likely to develop a disease. Disease risk factors aren’t the same thing as disease causes. Having a risk factor means that you have an increased chance of developing the disease, but you may not get the disease even if you meet the risk factors.For example, age is often listed as a risk factor for various diseases. Aging itself isn’t the cause of the disease. What makes it a risk factor is that the disease is seen more often in older adults.Leukemia has slightly different risk factors depending on the type. The four types of leukemia are:acute myeloid leukemia (AML)acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)Risk factors that make you more likely to develop one of these four types of leukemia are listed below.Genetic disordersHaving certain genetic disorders can increase your risk of also developing AML and ALL. These conditions include:Klinefelter syndromeFanconi anemiaDown syndromeLi-Fraumeni syndromeBloom syndromeataxia-telangiectasianeurofibromatosisSmokingThis lifestyle-related factor can increase your risk of AML. This is one of the few things that you can change to help reduce your risk of leukemia.Blood disordersCertain blood disorders can also put you at risk of developing AML. These include:myelodysplasiapolycythemia veraprimary thrombocythemiaExposure to certain chemicalsFrequent exposure to some chemicals increases the risk of AML, ALL, and CLL. One of the main chemicals that has been linked to leukemia is benzene. Benzene is found in:gasolineoil refineriesshoe manufacturing plantsthe rubber industrychemical plantsPeople who have been exposed to Agent Orange, a chemical used during the Vietnam War, have an increased risk of developing CLL.Previous cancer treatmentsRadiation is a risk factor for AML, ALL, and CML. This means that people who have gone through cancer radiation treatments have an increased risk of leukemia.Previous cancer treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs is also a risk factor for leukemia. These drugs include:alkylating agentsplatinum agentstopoisomerase II inhibitorsYou have increased risk of developing leukemia if you’ve had both chemotherapy and radiation treatment. A review article from 2012 explains that many scientists agree that the dose of radiation used in diagnostic testing is enough to induce cancer. However, the review also explains that potential benefits of testing may outweigh the risk of radiation exposure.AgeThe risk of developing AML and CLL increases with age.GenderMen are slightly more likely than women to develop all four types of leukemia.RaceResearchers have found that certain groups of people are more likely to develop some types of leukemia. For example, people of European descent have an increased risk of CLL. Researchers also found that leukemia is rare in people of Asian descent. These different risks are likely due to different genetic predispositions.Family historyLeukemia is generally not considered a hereditary disease. However, having a close family member with leukemia increases your risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. According to a 2013 paper published in Seminars in Hematology, research points to an inherited factor for CLL. This leukemia does occur more often in people who have a close family member who also had leukemia. Close family members are medically defined as your first-degree family, meaning your father, mother, and siblings.People with identical twins who developed acute lymphocytic leukemia before the age of 12 months also have an increased risk of that type of leukemia.Viral infectionInfection with the human T-cell lymphoma/leukemia virus-1 has been found to be a risk factor for ALL. This is more commonly found in Japan and the Caribbean, according to the American Cancer Society. It’s important to note that even for people who have some of these risk factors, most won’t get leukemia. The opposite is also true: People who have no risk factors can still be diagnosed with leukemia. What can you do to reduce your risk?Some risk factors aren’t preventable. Even people who have no risk factors can still be diagnosed with leukemia, so there is no way to absolutely prevent leukemia. However, there are a few things you can do to lower your risk. TipsStop smoking, or don’t start in the first place.Avoid close contact with high-risk chemicals, such as benzene.Avoid exposure to radiation.Exercise and eat a healthy diet to support a strong immune system.A 2004 study has found a link between breastfeeding and lower risk of leukemia in children. When to see a doctorIf you work in an industry that brings you in close contact with benzene, it’s important to let your doctor know. You should also let your doctor know if you’ve been exposed to radiation and chemotherapy drugs during previous cancer treatment. Your doctor can do blood tests to check you for leukemia. Testing won’t prevent the leukemia from developing, but an early diagnosis gives the best chance for an early recovery.If you have any of the following symptoms, you should make an appointment with your doctor for blood tests to confirm or rule out leukemia:extreme pain in your jointsfeversnighttime sweatingweaknessexhaustionfrequent infectionsloss of appetiteweight loss bruising easilyunexplained bleedingLeukemia symptoms often resemble much more common health issues, like the flu. However, the symptoms may be more severe. Because leukemia affects your white blood cells, frequent infections may indicate something more serious than the flu. If you have flu-like symptoms or other infections that are more frequent than usual, call your doctor and ask for a blood test.",https://www.healthline.com/health/leukemia-hereditary,Leukemia,Leukemia and Your Risk Factors: Is It Hereditary?
132," Is there a connection?If you have leukemia and experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue, dizziness, or paleness, you may also have anemia. Anemia is a condition in which you have unusually low levels of red blood cells. Here’s more about the link between leukemia and anemia.Bone marrow is a spongy material found in the middle of some of your bones. It contains stem cells, which develop into blood cells. Leukemia occurs when cancerous blood cells form in your blood marrow and crowd out healthy blood cells.  Types of anemia and leukemiaThe type of blood cells that are involved determines the type of leukemia. Some types of leukemia are acute and progress quickly. Others are chronic and grow slowly. The most common type of anemia people experience is iron-deficiency anemia. Low iron levels in the body can cause this. Aplastic anemia is a severe form of anemia that can occur due to exposure to:a wide variety of drugs and chemicalsionizing radiationsome virusesan autoimmune disorderIt may also be linked to leukemia and cancer treatments. What are the symptoms of anemia?Anemia can cause one or more of these symptoms:fatigueshortness of breathdizziness lightheadednessa fast or irregular heart ratepale skinfrequent infections easy bruisingnosebleedsbleeding gumsheadachescuts that bleed excessively What causes anemia?Your body may not have enough red blood cells for a number of reasons. Your body may not make enough to begin with or even destroy the red blood cells that you do have. You can also lose red blood cells more quickly when you’re bleeding, whether it’s due to injury or menstruation.If you have leukemia, both the disease itself and the treatments for it may cause you to develop anemia. Cancer treatmentsChemotherapy, radiation, and some drugs doctors use to treat leukemia may cause aplastic anemia. This is because some cancer therapies prevent bone marrow from making new, healthy blood cells. White blood cell counts drop first, then platelet counts, and finally, red blood cell counts. Anemia due to cancer treatments may be reversible after treatment ends or it may last for several weeks. LeukemiaLeukemia itself can also cause anemia. As leukemia blood cells multiply rapidly, little room is left for normal red blood cells to develop. If your red blood cell counts drop too low, anemia can occur.Cancer treatments may cause a decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. This often makes it difficult to eat a nutritious, iron-rich diet. This may lead to iron-deficiency anemia. How is anemia diagnosed?If your doctor thinks you have anemia, they’ll order blood tests to check your blood cell levels and platelet levels. They may also order a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, a small sample of bone marrow is removed from a large bone, such as your hipbone. The sample is examined to confirm an anemia diagnosis. Learn more: 7 important symptoms of leukemia in children » How is anemia treated?Anemia treatments depend on the severity of your symptoms and the cause of your anemia. If chemotherapy is causing your anemia, your doctor may prescribe injectable drugs, such as Epogen or Aranesp. These drugs tell your bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. They also have the potential to cause serious side effects, such as blood clots or increased risk of death. As a result, you should use the lowest dose possible for only as long as it takes to regulate your red blood cell levels. Your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements to treat iron-deficiency anemia. If anemia occurs due to blood loss, your doctor will need to determine the cause and treat it. Because blood loss often occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, your doctor may recommend a colonoscopy and an endoscopy to view your stomach and intestines. A blood transfusion is sometimes necessary to treat acute anemia. A transfusion alone may not be enough to control anemia in the long term. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, physician-scientists have discovered a chemotherapy drug called cyclophosphamide that helps treat aplastic anemia without harming blood and bone marrow-forming stem cells. Other treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions, drug therapies, and bone marrow transplants.  What you can do nowIf you think you have anemia, you should consult your doctor. They’ll review your symptoms and order the necessary tests to make a diagnosis. Don’t attempt to self-diagnose or self-treat anemia, especially if you have leukemia or any other medical condition. With treatment, anemia is manageable or curable. It may cause serious symptoms if you don’t get treatment for it.If you have anemia, you can expect to have symptoms such as fatigue and weakness until your blood cell counts improve. The symptoms often improve rapidly once treatment starts. In the meantime, doing the following can help you cope: Listen to your body’s signals, and rest when you’re tired or not feeling well.Stick to a regular sleep schedule.Ask for help with meals and household chores. Eat a healthy, nutrient-rich diet, including iron-rich eggs, red meat, and liver.Avoid activities that can increase your bleeding risk.If you don’t experience relief with treatment or you have shortness of breath at rest, chest pain, or faintness, you should seek immediate medical attention.If you have leukemia and develop anemia, your doctor will work with you to relieve your symptoms. Many treatment options can reduce anemia side effects during cancer treatment. The earlier you seek treatment, the less likely you are to develop serious complications.

133,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a progressive type of cancer that affects your bone marrow and blood cells. Early detection and treatment are important to help increase the chances of survival from this cancer. See a doctor right away if you notice any possible early symptoms. These include: recurring infectionschronic feverunusual bleedingAccording to the National Cancer Institute, about 30 percent of people diagnosed with AML survive 5 years or longer.When receiving an AML diagnosis, it’s also important to discuss information about stages and prognosis with your doctor. Read on to learn some of the facts that can help you start this conversation. What are the stages of AML?AML affects the bone marrow’s ability to produce normal-functioning white and red blood cells, as well as blood platelets. Instead, the bone marrow produces blast cells, which aren’t completely formed.Your oncologist will also “stage” your AML based on overall blood cell counts and whether there are leukemia cells in vital organs, such as the liver. This is different than stages for other cancers, which are typically based on the size of tumors and their spread (metastasis).In some cases, AML is often not detected until it has spread to organs. Overall staging of this cancer depends on:how much it has spreadthe amount of leukemia cells in the bodyhow many healthy blood cells you haveBelow are the nine stages of AML:M0: undifferentiated AMLM1: myeloblastic leukemia with minimal maturation (bone marrow cells show some signs of differentiation with minimal maturation)M2: myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (bone marrow cells show varying amounts of maturation)M3: promyelocytic leukemiaM4: myelomonocytic leukemiaM4 eos: myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophiliaM5: monocytic leukemiaM6: erythroid leukemiaM7: megakaryoblastic leukemia These stages (also known as subtypes) affect cells that form the bone marrow in the following manner:M0—M5: starts in white blood cellsM6: begins in red blood cellsM7: affects blood plateletsWhat factors affect chances of recovery?AML tends to progress rapidly. Recovery may depend on the subtype, as well as the following factors:being over age 60having a prior history of blood disordersa white blood cell count measuring 100,000/mm3 or morespread of the cancer to your spleen, liver, or other organsspread of the cancer to your brain or spinal cordchromosome abnormalities in cellsabnormal genes in leukemia cellsblood infectionsAlso, recovery from AML may be more challenging if your case is the result of treatment for a separate cancer.The odds of recovery are greater depending on how the body responds to treatment early on. Cases of “active disease” soon after treatment or during a relapse may present a more challenging prognosis. The term active disease means that the leukemia is still present.What is the average lifespan for someone diagnosed with AML?There’s no definitive way to determine a person’s lifespan after being diagnosed with AML.While about 30 percent of people with AML survive at least 5 years, the exact estimated lifespan after being diagnosed with AML depends on a variety of factors. These include: how aggressive the cancer is upon diagnosisyour ageyour overall response to treatmentAML is the most common acute leukemia, and the National Organization for Rare Disorders estimates that at least half of people who receive a diagnosis are 65 years old or more.Younger people under age 60 who have AML may be more responsive to early treatment and achieve remission, according to the American Cancer Society.What are the symptoms of the final stages of AML?Symptoms of the final stages of AML are similar to end-stage symptoms of all types of leukemia. These may include:cool, dry skinslow or labored breathingblurry visiondecreased urination or incontinencerestlessness or involuntary muscle movementsdecreased movements or weaknessloss of appetite and decreased fluid intakeincreased drowsiness and sleepinesschanges in heart ratesigns of bleeding, such as under the skin (petechiae) or from the nosepainhallucinationsconfusionloss of consciousnessWhat happens during the final stages?The exact prognosis regarding the final stages of AML depends on any related complications. For example, one 2015 study of people over age 60 with this cancer found an increased risk of bleeding and infections resulting in hospitalization, rather than hospice care.Another 2015 study showed that most people in the final stages of AML are hospitalized. The chances of being at home were increased during active or relapse stages, in which palliative care was used. Researchers also noted that fewer people were in hospice during AML end stages.Outlook for those with AMLWhile AML can progress rapidly, an early diagnosis — followed by aggressive treatment — may help you live as long as possible.Despite treatment, there are certain factors that can increase the risk of reaching the end stages of AML. These include older age, cancer subtype, and whether the cancer has spread to vital organs.It’s important to discuss all aspects of AML with your doctor, including the subtype and treatment options, so you can make informed decisions to help prolong your life.Where to find support for AMLWorking through a terminal AML prognosis can be difficult, and social-emotional support may be more important than ever at this stage.There are a variety of in-person and online leukemia support groups available for both patients and their loved ones. These groups provide opportunities to connect with others who may be going through similar experiences.Consider the following resources to aid in your search:Know AML support groupsLeukemia and Lymphoma Society’s local support groupsCancerCare support groups (both in-person and online options available)AML Support Group (Facebook)Adult AML Support Group (Facebook)",https://www.healthline.com/health/final-stages-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia,Leukemia,What Are the Final Stages of Acute Myeloid Leukemia?
134,"When you have leukemia, it can either be acute or chronic. Acute leukemia develops quickly and needs prompt treatment. Chronic leukemia develops slowly and may need management over many years.Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. It happens when blood cells in the bone marrow malfunction and form cancerous cells. The cancerous blood cells then overrun the healthy blood cells.This interferes with the body’s ability to fight infections, control bleeding, and deliver oxygen to healthy cells. The cancerous cells can also invade the spleen, liver, and other organs.Different types of leukemiaThere are four main types of leukemia.These include:acute myeloid leukemia (AML)chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)Each type of leukemia above is labeled either “acute” or “chronic.” This represents how quickly or slowly the cancer may progress.What is acute leukemia?Acute leukemia is a fast-growing leukemia. Without treatment, it progresses quickly. Treatment should be administered as soon as possible to ensure the best possible outcome.What is chronic leukemia?Chronic leukemia is a slow-growing leukemia. In these cases, the cells mature partly, but not completely. Despite appearing as healthy cells, they do not fight infection as well as typical white blood cells do. Unlike with acute leukemia, it can take years for health problems to appear in cases of chronic leukemia.Is chronic or acute leukemia worse?There’s really no correct answer to this question. It depends on each individual’s own circumstances.Chronic leukemia may take years to progress. As a result, some people may have more time to live their usual daily lives. On the other hand, acute leukemia spreads faster, which means treatment should start immediately.It’s most important to seek treatment as soon as you suspect something might be wrong and remember that you are your own best advocate.Learn more about leukemia.Signs and symptomsThe signs and symptoms for chronic and acute leukemia differ. Below we break down each type.Signs and symptoms of chronic leukemiaChronic leukemia develops slowly, and the early symptoms may be mild and go unnoticed.Chronic leukemia is most commonly diagnosed after a routine blood test. You may have low level symptoms for years before it’s diagnosed. The symptoms may be vague and could occur due to many other medical conditions. The signs and symptoms may include:general feelings of malaise, such as tiredness, bone and joint pain, or shortness of breathweight lossloss of appetitefevernight sweatsanemiainfectionsbruising or bleeding, such as nosebleedsenlarged lymph nodes that aren’t painfulpain or a full feeling in the upper-left abdomen, which is where the spleen is locatedSigns and symptoms of acute leukemiaAcute leukemia develops quickly. This is because the cancerous cells multiply fast.The common signs and symptoms of acute leukemia are:low white blood cell countsinfectionstiredness that doesn’t go away with restshortness of breathpale skinsweating at nightslight feverbruising easilybone and joint achesslow healing of cutstiny red dots under the skinSee the symptoms of leukemia in pictures.CausesNo one knows the cause of leukemia or why some people have chronic leukemia and others have an acute form of the condition. Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved.Leukemia occurs due to changes in the DNA of your cells. CML may also be associated with a gene mutation called the Philadelphia chromosome, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). This gene mutation isn’t inherited.The ACS says that a combination of genetic and environmental factors are involved in childhood leukemia. Some children may not have inherited the particular version of genes that can get rid of harmful chemicals. Exposure to those chemicals might increase their risk of leukemia.Risk factorsPossible risk factors for the different types of leukemia exist, but it’s possible to get leukemia even if you don’t have any of the known risk factors. Experts still don’t understand a lot about leukemia.Some factors for developing chronic leukemia include:being over 60 years oldbeing of European descentexposure to chemicals such as benzene or Agent Orangeexposure to high levels of radiationSome risk factors for developing acute leukemia include:smoking cigaretteshaving chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancersexposure to very high radiation levelshaving genetic disorders, such as Down syndromehaving a sibling with ALLHaving one or more of these risk factors doesn’t mean that you’ll get leukemia.How is leukemia diagnosed?All types of leukemia are diagnosed by examining blood samples and bone marrow. A complete blood count will show the levels and types of:white blood cellsleukemia cellsred blood cellsplateletsBone marrow and other tests will give your doctor further information about your blood to confirm a diagnosis of leukemia. Your doctor may also look at a blood smear under a microscope to see the shape of the cells. Other tests may grow your blood cells to help your doctor identify changes to the chromosomes or genes.TreatmentsYour treatment plan will depend on the type of leukemia you have and how advanced it is at the time of your diagnosis. You may want to get a second opinion before starting treatment. It’s important to understand what your treatment choices are and what you can expect.Chronic leukemiaChronic leukemia progresses slowly. It may not be diagnosed until symptoms, such as enlarged lymph nodes, appear. Chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies may be used to control the cancer. Your doctor may use blood transfusions and platelet transfusions to treat the decrease in red blood cells and platelets. Radiation may help reduce the size of your lymph nodes.If you have CML and also have the Philadelphia chromosome, your doctor may treat you with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). TKIs block the protein produced by the Philadelphia chromosome. They may also use stem cell therapy to replace cancerous bone marrow with healthy bone marrow.Acute leukemiaPeople with acute leukemia will generally begin treatment quickly following a diagnosis. This is because the cancer can progress quickly. Treatment may include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or stem cell therapy, depending on the type of acute leukemia you have.The treatment for acute leukemia is generally very intense in the beginning. The main goal of treatment is to kill the leukemia cells. Hospitalization is sometimes necessary. The treatment often causes side effects.Your doctor will do regular blood and bone marrow tests to determine how well your treatment is killing the leukemia cells. They may try various mixtures of drugs to see what works best.Once your blood has returned to baseline, your leukemia will be in remission. Your doctor will continue to test you in case the cancerous cells return.What is the outlook?Each type of leukemia is different and will require different treatment. The outlook is also unique to the type of leukemia you have and how advanced it is when you begin treatment. Other factors that will affect your outlook are: your ageyour general healthhow much the leukemia has spread in your bodyhow well you respond to treatmentSurvival rates for leukemia have greatly improved in the last 50 years. New drugs and new types of treatments continue to be developed.Your doctor will give you your outlook based on leukemia research findings from past years. These statistics are based on people who had your type of leukemia, but each person is different. Try not to focus too much on these types of statistics if you receive a diagnosis of leukemia. Your outlook will depend on your age, your overall health, and the stage of your leukemia.The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society gives the following 5-year survival rates for people with different types of leukemia in the United States from 2010 to 2016:CML: 71.7 percentCLL: 88.6 percentALL: 72.1 percent overall; 92.5 percent for those under 15 years old; 94.4 percent for those under 5 years oldAML: 29.8 percent overall and 70.6 percent for children and adolescents younger than 15 years oldThe outlook for people with any type of leukemia will continue to improve as the research advances. Researchers in many ongoing clinical trials are testing new treatments for each type of leukemia.PreventionNo early screening tests for leukemia are available. If you have risk factors and symptoms, ask your doctor about blood tests.It’s important to keep copies of your treatments, the dates, and the drugs that were used. These will help you and your future doctors if your cancer comes back.Experts haven’t found ways to prevent leukemia. Being proactive and telling your doctor if you notice any symptoms of leukemia may improve your chances of recovery.",https://www.healthline.com/health/chronic-vs-acute-leukemia,Leukemia,Acute and Chronic Leukemia: What Are the Differences?
135," OverviewLeukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the blood or blood-forming tissues. There are many different types of leukemia, and treatment is different for each one. Chronic leukemias are slower growing than acute leukemias, but can be just as life-threatening.Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is also called chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, and chronic granulocytic leukemia.This is a cancer of the white blood cells. In CML, blast cells, or immature white blood cells, form and multiply uncontrollably, they crowd out all the other types of necessary blood cells. Symptoms of chronic myeloid leukemiaThe symptoms of CML can also be symptoms of a variety of other conditions, which can make them easy to be ignored or dismissed. They include:anemiaweaknesstirednessshortness of breathnight sweatsbone painweight lossfeversense of “fullness” or bloating in the stomachfeeling full after eating, even if only a small amountSymptoms alone will not be enough to diagnose CML because they’re common in several types of cancers, as well as other more common conditions.Your doctor will need to conduct a physical exam and laboratory tests to confirm a diagnosis. CML can affect your body in other ways, too, especially if you undergo chemotherapy treatment. Chronic myeloid leukemia causesCML is caused by a genetic mutation. Doctors do not know what causes the initial mutation. But they do know the genetic mutation that leads to CML is not passed on by parents.In humans, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes. In individuals with CML, part of chromosome 9 is switched with a piece of chromosome 22. This makes a short chromosome 22 and a very long chromosome 9.According to Mayo Clinic, the short chromosome 22 is called the Philadelphia chromosome, and is present in 90 percent of CML patients. Genes from chromosomes 9 and 22 combine to form the BCR-ABL gene that enables specific blood cells to multiply uncontrollably, causing CML. Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemiaThere are multiple treatments for CML. Your treatment may vary depending on your health and the progression of the disease.Targeted therapiesTargeted therapies are typically used first in CML treatment. These are drugs that attack a specific part of the cancer cell to kill it.In the case of CML, these drugs block the protein made by the BCR-ABL gene. They may include imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib.ChemotherapyChemotherapy involves using drugs to kill cancer cells. These drugs are systemic, which means they travel through your entire body via your bloodstream.They can be given intravenously or orally, depending on the specific drug. Chemotherapy is a common cancer treatment with side effects that may be intense.Bone marrow transplantA bone marrow transplant (also called a blood stem cell transplant) might be used when other treatments have failed. This is because the procedure is risky, and a matching donor might be difficult to find.In this type of transplant, chemotherapy is used to kill the cancerous cells in your bone marrow before healthy donor cells are infused into your blood to replace them.Side effects of this procedure vary widely but can include minor things, like chills and flushing, or major complications, like anemia, infections, and cataracts.These treatments can be used alone, or in combination with one another. Read more about how CML treatments work, and talk with your doctor about which treatment options are best for you. Chronic myeloid leukemia diagnosisBecause CML generally does not cause symptoms in its early stages, the cancer is often detected during a routine blood test. When there are symptoms, they’re typically hard to identify as being caused by CML rather than another health condition.If tests suggest that you may have cancer, a bone marrow biopsy is performed. This is to get a sample of bone marrow to send to a lab for analysis. A special needle with a tube will be inserted into either your hipbone or breastbone, and a small piece of bone marrow suctioned out.Once diagnosed, tests will be done to see how the cancer is behaving in your body. These tests help doctors figure out which treatments will be most effective. They may include additional blood work and genetic tests.Imaging tests, like an MRI, ultrasound, and CT scan, can also be used to determine where the cancer has spread. If you were recently diagnosed with CML, this guide can help you understand the diagnosis and what you need to do next. Chronic myeloid leukemia prognosisThe prognosis for people diagnosed with CML is generally good, and it’s getting better. New treatments are better at targeting tyrosine kinase, the protein that causes CML.Likewise, large-scale studies are finding new, more effective treatment options every year.Factors that can affect your prognosis include:agephase of CMLoverall healthplatelet countswhether your spleen is enlargedamount of bone damage caused by the leukemiaThe news of a cancer diagnosis can be difficult, even if you’re told the prognosis is good. Learn about the life expectancy and prognosis after a CML diagnosis. Stages of chronic myeloid leukemiaCML has different phases or stages of progression. Which stage the disease is in determines the appropriate treatment. The stages are based on the number of blast cells present and include:The chronic phaseThis is the earliest stage of CML. You may have some symptoms or none at all. During this phase, your white blood cells can still fight infections in your body.The accelerated phaseIn this phase, your red blood cell counts are low, and anemia (not enough iron in your blood) may occur.Platelet levels are also reduced, which may cause easy bruising or bleeding because platelets help to form blood clots. The amount of blast cells increases. A fairly common complication at this point is a swollen spleen, which may cause stomach pain.The blast crisis (blastic) phaseA large number of blast cells are present in this advanced phase. Symptoms in this phase are more severe and can be life-threatening.Knowing more about the phases of CML can help you understand treatment options. Chronic myeloid leukemia survival rateThe percentage of people living five years after a CML diagnosis who are treated with imatinib is 90 percent. But that number is expected to continue to improve as more people with CML use newer targeted therapies.Most individuals with CML remain in the chronic phase. If they don’t respond well to treatment or don’t take treatment, they can advance to the accelerated or blastic phase.Life expectancy is shorter in these later stages. But certain health and lifestyle factors can also influence survival rates. Learn what those are and how you can improve them. Chronic myeloid leukemia life expectancyImprovements in CML treatment mean that life expectancy is improving every year.In 1990, a diagnosis of CML reduced life expectancy of a 55-year-old woman by 24.9 years. In 2010, however, a CML diagnosis only reduced life expectancy by 2.9 years.The greatest increase in life expectancy has been seen in younger people, though older people also see more years.In fact, in 2013, the life expectancy of patients diagnosed with CML was the closest it has ever been to the life expectancy of the general population. Each CML phase impacts life expectancy after diagnosis. Learn how. One large study showed that 90 percent of persons treated with imatinib were still alive after 5 years. In addition, 89 percent at 6 years, 86 percent at 8 years, and 83-84 percent survived 10 years.  Chronic myeloid leukemia dietCML can impact your overall health, causing fatigue and weakness. It can also compromise your immune system, leaving you open to viruses and bacteria that could make you ill. Diet is one way you can boost energy, support your immune system, and boost your overall well-being.Eat these foods to get more nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and carotenoids in your daily diet:whole grains and legumeslow-fat, lean meats like fish and poultry5 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetableslow-fat dairyCML treatments can affect your appetite. But eating a balanced diet is important when you’re undergoing treatments. A healthy diet can reduce side effects and help keep your immune system strong. These tips may help make eating easier when you’re undergoing treatment.",https://www.healthline.com/health/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia-cml,Leukemia,Everything You Want to Know About Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
136,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common types of adult leukemia. It begins in the bone marrow, leading to an overproduction of a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes.  Unlike other forms of leukemia, CLL tends to develop gradually. While early symptoms may include fatigue and enlarged lymph nodes, it’s also possible to experience various skin issues or cutaneous lesions.  It’s estimated that 25 percent of people with CLL experience skin lesions. Additionally, CLL may also increase your risk of developing secondary skin cancers.  Learn more about CLL skin lesions, including their causes, what they look like, and how they’re usually treated.   Symptoms of CLL-related skin issues Symptoms of CLL-related skin lesions can differ from person to person, but may include the following: widespread redness and inflammation of your skin (exfoliative erythroderma)general itchiness of your skin, with or without lesions or plaqueslarge, painful nodules (nodular erythema)large, itchy, fluid-filled blisters (bullous pemphigoid)large, painful blisters that can appear on your lips, mouth, and skin (paraneoplastic pemphigus)an increased risk of skin infections, such as after being bit by a bug CLL may also cause you to bleed or bruise easily. As the cancer progresses, this can lead to small pinpoints of dark spots under your skin called petechiae. Causes of CLL skin lesionsCLL is a slow-developing form of leukemia. You may not experience symptoms such as skin lesions until the cancer has progressed.  If you have CLL, blood stem cells that normally become healthy red or white blood cells turn into atypical lymphocytes instead.  Also called leukemia cells, these lymphocytes may crowd your blood and bone marrow, spreading into your skin and decreasing healthy red and white blood cells as well as platelets.  There are three types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes (B cells), which usually create antibodies that help fight infectionsT lymphocytes, which help create antibodies for B cells“natural killer cells,” which fight viruses and cancerous cells Having too many lymphocytes from CLL may also result in skin lesions and increase your risk of related infections. CLL-related skin lesions are also called leukemia cutis. Types of CLL skin lesions The types of skin lesions that may be associated with CLL include: bullous pemphigoidexfoliative erythrodermanodular erythemaparaneoplastic pemphigusCLL and skin cancer With CLL, you may be up to 8 times more likely to develop secondary skin cancers compared to someone who does not have this cancer. These secondary skin cancers can include: basal cell carcinomamelanomaMerkel tumorssquamous cell carcinoma Since the risk of developing secondary skin cancers from CLL is high, it’s important to check your skin at least monthly for any signs of suspicious lesions.  Contact a doctor or dermatologist if you notice: a mole that is changing in size and color and that looks different from other moles you may havea scaly patch that does not go awayany dome-shaped growthsitching, bleeding, or nonhealing sores that do not go away or that returnstreaks under your nails that are brown or black A dermatologist may conduct a biopsy of the lesion. This involves taking a small sample of the mole or lesion to look for cancerous cells under a microscope.  The earlier skin cancer is found, the sooner you can start treatment and stop it from spreading. What are the treatment options? Treatment for CLL-related skin lesions usually involves targeting the underlying cancer cells. Treatment options for CLL may include: chemotherapy, which kills cancer cellsleukapheresis, which involves removing white blood cells via a specialized machineradiation therapy, which destroys cancer cells with high energy raysstem cell transplants, with or without chemotherapytargeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies If you’re experiencing skin infections from leukemia cutis, you may also need to take antibiotics to help prevent the spread of bacteria. Potential complications It’s important to see a doctor to address unusual skin lesions. Not only is there an increased risk of infections, but these lesions could also be signs of CLL progression.  CLL may spread to other parts of your body, especially the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Aside from skin lesions and secondary skin cancers, other possible signs of CLL progression may include: extreme fatigue and weaknessswollen but painless lymph nodesfrequent infectionsnight sweatsfullness or pain below your ribsunintentional weight lossRichter’s syndrome A doctor will check your white and red blood cell numbers as well as your platelets to determine the extent of the cancer. Imaging tests, such as X-rays, may also be needed to see whether CLL has spread. The bottom line CLL skin lesions occur when leukemia cells enter the skin. This can cause skin issues, such as bruises, blisters, plaques, and tumors. Widespread redness, itchiness, and inflammation are also possible.  While not the most common early symptoms of CLL, skin lesions could indicate that the cancer has spread. It’s also possible to develop secondary skin cancers once you have CLL.  It’s important to see a doctor right away if you develop any new skin lesions, unusual moles, or signs of a skin infection. Treatment for CLL may help improve symptoms of related skin lesions. Secondary skin cancers and infections will require separate treatments.

137,"The HTLV-1 virus is spreading in some remote parts of Australia. Doctors want researchers to start working on treatments for this potentially dangerous pathogen.Share on PinterestIt’s a virus that few people have heard of, but doctors around the world are urging the World Health Organization (WHO) to take action against it.The virus in question is called HTLV-1, and in some cases, it can cause leukemia.The pathogen has also been dubbed a cousin of HIV because of the similarities in the way it’s spread.Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was first discovered in 1980, but it is believed the ancient virus was first present in nonhuman primates 40,000 to 60,000 years ago.The virus does not negatively impact all carriers of the disease, but in some patients, it can cause spinal cord injury, inflammatory conditions, problems with mobility, and an aggressive form of leukemia.“Ninety percent of the time, this will not trouble you, you will not be aware of it… But there’s another side of the coin, which is: Then why do we bother with it? Well… it does cause serious disease in the remaining ten percent, and it causes a very aggressive white blood cell cancer. It’s called adult T-cell leukemia,” Dr. Graham Taylor, professor of human retrovirology at Imperial College London, told Healthline.“This is probably one of the most aggressive blood cancers, very difficult to treat, and with the best efforts… people still die. Fifty percent are dead within eight months. So that’s why we can’t ignore it,” he explained.Taylor, along with 60 other co-signatories around the world, have written an open letter to WHO officials, urging them to “support the promotion of proven effective transmission prevention strategies against one of the most potent human carcinogens.”HTLV-1 is spread in the same way as HIV.It’s transmitted through bodily fluids from unprotected sexual intercourse, sharing of needles, breastfeeding, and through transfusions or transplants of infected blood or organs.There is no cure and no vaccine against the virus.“HTLV-1 is a virus that only obeys the laws of evolution and survival of the fittest. It will transmit efficiently where community practices provide an opportunity, and the virus over centuries will evolve to maximize its transmission efficiency during these opportunities,” Damian Purcell, PhD, the head of the molecular virology laboratory at The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at The University of Melbourne, told Healthline.The spread in AustraliaIn Australia, where Purcell is based, HTLV-1 has reached what has been described as “hyperendemic numbers” among Australia’s indigenous population in the central part of the country.In some aboriginal communities, 45 percent of adults live with HTLV-1. That’s an estimated 5,000 infected people in some of Australia’s most remote communities.The virus is also prevalent in Brazil, the Central African Republic, Gabon, Iran, Jamaica, Nigeria, Romania, and Japan.In Australia, a large number of indigenous communities have never been tested. The situation is complicated by healthcare access as well as cultural practices.“The story of HTLV-1 in Australia has been complicated by the extreme remoteness of many of the newly identified high-prevalence communities, and in the early investigations, the lack of ethical consent given in primary language to test samples for HTLV-1,” Purcell said.“The Australian experience tells us that HTLV-1 infections can become highly entrenched in communities that have preserved practices that allow an opportunity for HTLV-1 transmission,” he added. “It can be difficult to identify and modify these practices, especially when they occur in communities where they contribute to cultural identity.”The global effectsBut it’s not just Australia’s indigenous populations who are affected by HTLV-1.The effects and social consequences of the virus are being felt all over the world.“As a stigmatizing sexually transmitted disease, it divides communities just like HIV. It is heart breaking really,” Dr. Fabiola Aghakhani Zandjani-Martin, a sexual health, HIV, and HTLV-1 physician and scientist at The University of Queensland, told Healthline. “Worldwide, it is mostly middle-aged women who are diagnosed with HTLV-1 diseases, and when they find out, their world falls apart. They have to ask themselves: How did I catch it? From my husband through sex, from my mother through breast milk? And then they need to consider having their children and grandchildren tested and examined.”“It is really difficult,” she added. “That is why healthcare providers need to learn how to provide a sensitive and nonjudgmental care while being informed about the latest advances in HTLV-1 medicine. It is a tough job for the clinician and an even tougher situation for the patient.”Taylor says 90 percent of patients don’t even know they have the virus, so they unknowingly pass it on to others.In many countries, there are no programs available to test for HTLV-1, meaning there is likely a higher number of infected patients around the world than is currently known.“You’ve kind of got a vicious circle; if nobody has heard about HTLV-1, then they’re not going to make a diagnosis of HTLV-1,” Taylor said. “So you then don’t see that there are people in your hospital, in your city, in your country who are HTLV-1-infected and developing disease.”But Taylor is hopeful steps will be taken to prevent the transmission of HTLV-1, starting with WHO officials recognizing it as a rare or neglected disease.“The huge strides we’ve made with HIV show just how much can be done with a problem that was appalling. Sitting there right beside it, discovered three years earlier, is HTLV-1, where you almost feel we’re no further on than back in the years immediately following its discovery,” he said.",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/scientists-urged-to-find-cure-for-virus-that-causes-leukemia,Leukemia,Scientists Urged to Find Cure for Rare Virus That Can Cause Leukemia
138," What is acute myeloid leukemia (AML)?Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that occurs in your blood and bone marrow.AML specifically affects the white blood cells (WBCs) of your body, causing them to form abnormally. In acute cancers, the number of abnormal cells grows rapidly.The condition is also known by the following names:acute myelocytic leukemiaacute myelogenous leukemiaacute granulocytic leukemiaacute non-lymphocytic leukemiaThere are an estimated 19,520 new cases of AML every year in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). What are the symptoms of AML?In its early stages, the symptoms of AML may resemble the flu and you may have a fever and fatigue.Other symptoms can include:bone painfrequent nosebleedsbleeding and swollen gumseasy bruisingexcessive sweating (particularly at night)shortness of breathunexplained weight lossheavier than normal periods in females What causes AML?AML is caused by abnormalities in the DNA that controls the development of cells in your bone marrow.If you have AML, your bone marrow creates countless WBCs that are immature. These abnormal cells eventually become leukemic WBCs called myeloblasts.These abnormal cells build up and replace healthy cells. This causes your bone marrow to stop functioning properly, making your body more susceptible to infections.It’s not clear exactly what causes the DNA mutation. Some doctors believe it may be related to exposure to certain chemicals, radiation, and even drugs used for chemotherapy. What raises your risk of AML?Your risk of developing AML increases with age. The median age for a person diagnosed with AML is about 68, and the condition is rarely seen in children.AML is also more common in men than women, although it affects boys and girls at equal rates.Cigarette smoking is thought to increase your risk of developing AML. If you work in an industry where you may have been exposed to chemicals such as benzene, you’re also at higher risk.Your risk also goes up if you have a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome.These risk factors don’t mean you’ll necessarily develop AML. At the same time, it’s possible for you to develop AML without having any of these risk factors. How is AML classified?The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system includes these different AML groups:AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal changesAML with myelodysplasia-related changestherapy-related myeloid neoplasms, which may be caused by radiation or chemotherapyAML, not otherwise specifiedmyeloid sarcomamyeloid proliferations of Down syndromeacute leukemia of ambiguous lineageSubtypes of AML also exist within these groups. The names of these subtypes may indicate the chromosomal change or genetic mutation that caused the AML.One such example is AML with t(8;21), where a change occurs between chromosomes 8 and 21.Unlike most other cancers, AML isn’t divided into traditional cancer stages. How is AML diagnosed?Your doctor will perform a physical exam and check for swelling of your liver, lymph nodes, and spleen. Your doctor may also order blood tests to check for anemia and to determine your WBC levels.While a blood test may help your doctor determine whether there’s a problem, a bone marrow test or biopsy is needed to diagnose AML definitively.A sample of bone marrow is taken by inserting a long needle into your hip bone. Sometimes the breastbone is the site of biopsy. The sample is sent to a lab for testing.Your doctor may also do a spinal tap, or lumbar puncture, which involves withdrawing fluid from your spine with a small needle. The fluid is checked for the presence of leukemia cells. What are the treatment options for AML?Treatment for AML involves two phases:Remission induction therapyRemission induction therapy uses chemotherapy to kill the existing leukemia cells in your body.Most people stay in the hospital during treatment because chemotherapy also kills healthy cells, raising your risk for infection and abnormal bleeding.In a rare form of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), anticancer drugs such as arsenic trioxide or all-trans retinoic acid may be used to target specific mutations in leukemia cells. These drugs kill the leukemia cells and stop the unhealthy cells from dividing.Consolidation therapyConsolidation therapy, which is also known as post-remission therapy, is crucial for keeping AML in remission and preventing a relapse. The goal of consolidation therapy is to destroy any remaining leukemia cells.You may require a stem cell transplant for consolidation therapy. Stem cells are often used to help your body generate new and healthy bone marrow cells.The stem cells may come from a donor. If you’ve previously had leukemia that’s gone into remission, your doctor may have removed and stored some of your own stem cells for a future transplant, known as an autologous stem cell transplant.Getting stem cells from a donor has more risks than getting a transplant made up of your own stem cells. A transplant of your own stem cells, however, involves a higher risk for relapse because some old leukemia cells may be present in the sample retrieved from your body. What’s expected in the long term for people with AML?When it comes to most types of AML, around two-thirds of people are able to achieve remission, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).The remission rate rises to nearly 90 percent for people with APL. Remission will depend on a variety of factors, such as a person’s age.The five-year survival rate for Americans with AML is 27.4 percent. The five-year survival rate for children with AML is between 60 and 70 percent.With early-phase detection and prompt treatment, remission is highly likely in most people. Once all signs and symptoms of AML have disappeared, you’re considered to be in remission. If you’re in remission for more than five years, you’re considered cured of AML.If you find that you have symptoms of AML, schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss them. You should also seek immediate medical attention if you have any signs of infection or a persistent fever. How can you prevent AML?If you work around hazardous chemicals or radiation, make sure to wear any and all available protective gear to limit your exposure.Always see a doctor if you have any symptoms you’re concerned about.",https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-myeloid-leukemia,Leukemia,Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
139,"The “Lemons for Leukemia” campaign has become a social media hit. It’s the latest viral video effort to raise money for disease research.Share on PinterestWhen life hands you lemons… you take a bite and film it for YouTube. That’s how the adage goes, right?It is if you’re 21-year-old Chris Betancourt and 19-year-old Dillon Hill, best friends and founders of Lemons for Leukemia, a social media campaign aimed at raising awareness for the bone marrow registry.In late 2017, Betancourt was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. Without a bone marrow transplant, doctors told Betancourt he had just one year to live.When he heard his friend’s news, Hill decided to take time off from college and help his buddy live every one of those days to its fullest. The two wrote Betancourt’s bucket list, everything he’d like to accomplish as long as he’s able, as a roadmap for their adventures and goals.“When we first had that phone call recently and he was re-diagnosed, he said he was afraid of not being able to experience some things in life that we all plan on doing, so we kind of just decided to make a bucket list and document every single moment of it,” Hill told “Good Morning America.” “I couldn’t sit in a lecture hall while he was potentially dying.”The friends are finding many wonderful events and firsts to do together — flying a plane, smashing guitars, being on TV — and documenting each of their adventures on their site One List, One Life and their YouTube channel.In addition to checking boxes on the list, however, the duo hopes to possibly save a few lives in the process — and make other cancer patients’ dreams come true, too.Eat a lemon, save a lifeThe Lemons for Leukemia social media campaign calls on participants to take a bite (or a squeeze) out of a lemon, film their puckered face reactions, share it on social media platforms, and challenge others to do the same.“I originally came up with the idea because of the sour taste chemo leaves in your mouth,” Betancourt told Healthline. “It’s not a pleasant experience, but you’ve just got to bite in.”The goal for the campaign is to raise awareness for the bone marrow donor registry and encourage individuals to sign up to be a donor. It’s a simple act, but it’s one that could save someone’s life, possibly Betancourt’s.To become a donor, you can register online with the National Bone Marrow Donor Program. A free cheek-swab kit will be sent to you. You’ll collect a sample and return the kit to the registry. If you’re matched with someone on the registry, you’ll undergo an out-patient procedure to extract bone marrow for the donation.On March 1, Hill and Betancourt set out to complete a bucket list item (“Set a world record”) and add as many names to the registry as they could. Their challenge was heeded by more than 3700 people, which was indeed a world record for the most number of donor list sign-ups in one day.As word of the challenge continues to spread, and more pucker-inducing videos of people eating lemons are shared, the list is gaining even more names and attention. Actor and comedian Danny DeVito even recently joined Betancourt for a few bites of a lemon.“We started off begging and almost paying our friends to film themselves with a lemon,” Hill told Healthline. “We didn’t expect it to explode so quickly. It’s incredible.”The power of social media charity campaignsIf the script for Lemons for Leukemia feels familiar, that’s because it is.Building on the success of several other charity video campaigns like the ALS Association’s Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised more than $100 million for the organization, stunt campaigns proliferate in the social media world.In fact, they’re quite common, which means they’re not always very successful.“A huge number of viral videos are cooked up in company marketing departments and released into the wild on a daily basis. Others are dreamed up by individuals in hopes of going viral,” Daniel Levine, a trends expert and keynote speaker, told Healthline. “Every few weeks, one seems to succeed. While many companies and basement YouTubers try to nail down the formula for viral success, at the end of the day, it’s like putting any product out there: you do your best and hope for market-pull.”Authenticity is one element of success, said Michelle Kubot, marketing director at Ambrosia Treatment Center, and not everyone has it.Campaigns such as Lemons for Leukemia, however, reach an emotional peak with people based on the campaign’s authentic call and response.“Lemons for Leukemia defied the odds because it wasn’t just a copy-cat campaign. It was 100 percent authentic,” Kubot told Healthline. “Most of our social media feeds are covered with smiling photos that have been staged and filtered until they hardly represent reality. Authenticity, therefore, stands out, and it’s not authentic to copy someone else’s successful campaign. Having a challenge just to have a challenge is not going to get results.”Perhaps that’s what makes Lemons for Leukemia stand out in a world of no-shave months, no-makeup selfies, and hot sauce eating challenges.It’s a campaign born from an immediate need — a bone marrow match could save Betancourt’s life — but it’s a bigger initiative, too.The more people who know about the registry, the more who will sign up. Every potential donor is a potential life saved and another day someone gets to mark things off their bucket lists.Currently, Betancourt and Hill are trying to recruit Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to lift weights — No. 13 on the list — and they’re making good on their promise to give back.“We want to help other cancer patients experience things from their bucket lists,” Hill said. “We’ve got some exciting things in the works.”",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-sucking-on-a-lemon-can-help-fight-leukemia,Leukemia,How Sucking on a Lemon Can Help Fight Leukemia
140,"The docking of two proteins that cause acute myeloid leukemia could pave the way for development of a new drug to fight the disease, as well as other types of leukemia and possibly other cancers.A team of researchers from the University of Queensland has discovered a molecular target that could result in the development of a new drug that could be used to battle acute myeloid leukemia (AML). What’s more, the researchers believe that if such a drug were developed, it might also be effective in the treatment of other forms of leukemia, and possibly different kinds of cancer. The research findings appear in the journal Blood.AML starts in the bone marrow, which is the soft inner part of the bones, where new blood cells are made. In most cases, it quickly moves into the blood. It can sometimes spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), and testicles.The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that in 2014, there will be about 52,380 new cases of all kinds of leukemia and 24,090 deaths from all kinds of leukemia. The ACS expects about 18,860 new cases of AML, most of which will be in adults. The ACS also estimates there will be about 10,460 deaths from AML. Again, almost all cases will be in adults.Learn More About Leukemia »Docking of Two Proteins The researchers found that the “docking” of one protein, called the Myb protein, with another protein, the p300 protein, was critical for the development of AML. Senior researcher, professor Tom Gonda of the University of Queensland School of Pharmacy, said in a press release that the Myb protein was produced by the MYB oncogene, a gene that had the potential to cause cancer and which was required for the continued growth of leukemia cells. “Our data identifies the critical role of this Myb-p300 interaction and shows that the disruption of this interaction could lead to a potential therapeutic strategy,” said Gonda.Gonda went on to say that the research could lead the way for development of a drug to block this interaction and stop the growth of AML cells, as well as the cells of other types of leukemia.Related News: Finding Cancer Drugs in Unlikely Places »Myb Protein Critical for Normal Blood Cell FormationCautioning that MYB is also essential for normal blood cell formation, Gonda said an approach for targeting it that won’t completely disrupt normal blood cell production is needed.The researchers’ work demonstrates that normal blood cells can continue to form even when the Myb-p300 interaction is unable to occur. This finding suggests that a drug that blocks the interaction could be safe for use in patients, according to the researchers.Watch Now: Survival Rates and Prognosis for Acute Myeloid Leukemia »Future Research Is NeededEmphasizing that the research is at a very early stage, Gonda said the researchers believe their findings have the potential to result in huge advantages in the fight against leukemia and, possibly, other cancers.Since Myb was not a conventional target for drugs, the team may study other ways to target MYB, including targeting the genes and proteins that work downstream of MYB.“If we can block the downstream molecules that are controlled by MYB, we may end up with the same result,” said Gonda.Finally, Gonda said, “Drug development and subsequent clinical trials are long processes, but we are hopeful this research has a promising future.”Learn About the Side Effects of Chemotherapy »",https://www.healthline.com/health-news/proteins-acute-myeloid-leukemia-drug-development-050714,Leukemia,Drug to Fight Acute Myeloid Leukemia Is Within Grasp of Researchers
141,"Blood transfusions are sometimes part of a leukemia treatment plan. They do not treat cancer, but they can help reduce some cancer symptoms. They’re used to treat low blood counts and help prevent infections, bleeding, bruising, and anemia.A transfusion provides your body with more blood through an intravenous (IV) line. The whole process usually takes several hours. Not everyone with leukemia will need blood transfusions. But they can make a difference for people with leukemia that causes low red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelet counts.How does leukemia affect the blood?Leukemia is a cancer of the blood. Blood Cancer UK says it affects the way your body makes blood cells. There are multiple types of leukemia, and most types mainly affect your body’s white blood cells. The white blood cells are the cells your body uses to fight infection.Most forms of leukemia cause a large amount of cancerous white blood cells to grow. This crowds out healthy white blood cells and makes it impossible for your immune system to fully function. As leukemia progresses, the cancerous white blood cells can also overwhelm your red blood cells and platelets. Too few red blood cells can result in anemia and too few platelets can make it difficult for your blood to clot.You can also develop anemia from leukemia treatments. Radiation and chemotherapy are used to kill cancer cells. The treatments can also prevent your body from making new healthy blood cells.Additionally, cancer treatments can make it hard to eat the food you need to get enough iron in your diet. A diet that is too low in iron can lead to anemia and fatigue.How does a blood transfusion help treat leukemia?A blood transfusion does not treat leukemia itself or fight cancer. But it does treat the symptoms caused by leukemia’s effects on your blood.The transfusion you receive will be of blood components taken from donated blood. The donated blood has been filtered and separated. So instead of receiving whole blood, you’ll just receive the component that is most helpful to you.For example, if you have anemia, you’ll just receive red blood cells. If you’re low in platelets, you can just receive platelets.Other components you can receive include:white cells, or granulocytesalbuminplasma and cryoprecipitategamma globulinTypes of blood transfusions used to treat leukemiaA few types of blood cell transfusion are commonly used to treat leukemia. According to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, they include:Red blood cell transfusions. These transfusions can treat anemia. They’re prescribed to people with leukemia who have low red blood cell counts and who are starting to experience anemia symptoms.Platelet transfusions. Doctors prescribe platelet transfusions to people with leukemia who have low platelet counts. They can treat and lower the risk of excessive bleed and bruising.Plasma and cryoprecipitate transfusions. These are sometimes ordered for people who have low levels of proteins that help their blood clot. This generally happens as a result of liver conditions and is less common in leukemia. However, it can occur in people with promyelocytic leukemia.Gamma globulin transfusions. Gamma globulins are proteins in blood plasma that help prevent infection. People with chronic lymphocytic leukemia often have low levels of gamma globulins and need a transfusion to replenish their blood.Albumin transfusions. These transfusions are less common. People who have liver conditions or whose leukemia has affected their liver might need an infusion of this blood protein.Granulocyte transfusions. Doctors sometimes prescribe these to people with low white blood cell counts to lower the risk of infection. They are infrequently performed and are not a routine part of leukemia care. This is due to difficulties in the collection, processing, administration, and potential adverse effects. Granulocytes are a type of white blood cell.How often do leukemia patients need blood transfusions?There is no standard or set amount of transfusions that people with leukemia need. Some people with leukemia might never require blood transfusions. Others might need them as frequently as multiple times per month. It’s more common for people with advanced leukemia to have frequent transfusions. But even at that stage, this doesn’t apply to every person.Possible reactions to a blood transfusionBlood transfusions are generally considered safe. Most people receive transfusions without any reactions. However, just like any medical procedure, there are some possible risks. Some reactions are immediate and will occur during or right after the transfusions. Other possible reactions won’t occur until weeks or even months later. Immediate side effects include:feverrashhivesnauseaback painlow blood pressureshortness of breathdark or red urinepain at the transfusion siteA fever is the most common side effect of transfusion. Let medical staff know right away if you experience any of these side effects. If needed, they can make changes such as stopping the transfusion early.Reactions that can develop weeks or months later include:Viral infection transmission. There is a slight risk of getting a viral disease from a blood transfusion. However, developments in blood testing have greatly lowered this risk over the past several decades.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission. CMV can cause pneumonia and other complications in people who are having stem cell transplants. Doctors are especially cautious about the risk of CMV transmission in people who have had a blood transfusion and who will be having stem cell transplants.Bacterial infection transmission. It’s rare to get a bacterial infection from a red blood cell transfusion, but it is possible. However, precautions are taken at blood facilities to make sure this risk remains very low.Alloimmunization. Alloimmunization occurs when your immune system makes antigens against the transfused blood. It doesn’t always cause symptoms, but it can make side effects during future blood transfusions more likely.Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a very rare reaction that can occur after a transfusion of white blood cells. In GVHD, the donor white blood cells attack your body’s skin, bone marrow, liver, and bowels, resulting in serious complications. Are blood transfusions safe?Blood transfusions are considered very safe. In the past, there was a risk of transmitting viral diseases through blood transfusions. Today, 12 different tests are performed on all donated blood. The risk of transmitting diseases through blood transfusions has dropped substantially.All donated blood in the United States is now tested for:HIV-1HIV-2hepatitis Bhepatitis Csyphilishuman T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV-1)Additional testing for diseases such as CMV and West Nile virus is sometimes also done.How to prepare for a blood transfusionAccording to the Canadian Cancer Society, there are very few steps you need to take to prepare for a non-emergency blood transfusion. You can maintain your usual diet and daily activities before your blood transfusion. Most blood transfusions are done in an outpatient clinic. Before your transfusion, it’s a good idea to:Ask your doctor how long the transfusion will take. Most transfusions take between 1 and 4 hours.Stay well hydrated.Pack a book or laptop to keep yourself occupied during the transfusion. You’ll usually be able to work, read, eat, or drink after the first 15 minutes or so of the transfusion as long as it doesn’t interfere with the IV line.Pack a water bottle and a light snack.Pack a blanket, hoodie, or sweater.Living with leukemiaIt’s important to find support when you’re managing a leukemia diagnosis.

They don’t fight cancer, but they can help treat low blood counts caused by leukemia and leukemia treatments.Blood transfusions might be ordered if you’re experiencing anemia, low platelet counts, or low white blood cell counts. Not everyone who has leukemia will need blood transfusions. Blood transfusions are generally considered safe, and serious reactions are rare thanks to improved blood testing in the past 20 years.",https://www.healthline.com/health/leukemia/why-do-leukemia-patients-need-blood-transfusions,Leukemia,Do Leukemia Patients Always Need Blood Transfusions?
142,"Share on PinterestAstrakan Images/Offset ImagesLeukemia refers to a type of cancer that impacts your blood cells and bone marrow. It’s the seventh most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.The outlook for leukemia can seem complicated to predict due to the different types of leukemia. Some leukemias are slow-growing (chronic), while others spread rapidly (acute). Also, each has varying symptoms and treatment options.Read on to learn more about each of the major subtypes of leukemia so that you can better understand what treatment options are best for you.Four main types of leukemiaThere are four main types of leukemia, and each affects the blood cells in different ways. Chronic forms of leukemia tend to affect middle-aged to older adults, while acute versions mostly affect children and young adults.Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)CML starts in your bone marrow, creating an abnormally high number of unhealthy white blood cells known as granulocytes. Also called chronic granulocytic (or myeloid) leukemia, CML is thought to be partially attributed to gene mutations called Philadelphia chromosomes.This type of leukemia is most common in middle-aged adults and is rare in children. It’s estimated that 15 percent of leukemia cases in adults are CML.As CML progresses, granulocytes take over your bone marrow and blood so that there’s no room for red blood cells, platelets, or healthy white blood cells.Some of the initial symptoms include: excessive fatigueunexplained weight lossnight sweatsfeverpain below your left ribcageIn some people, CML causes no symptoms at all.TreatmentsOne promising area of treatment for CML involves targeted therapies that treat abnormal mutations from the Philadelphia chromosome. Researchers have found that targeted therapies can help people with CML survive closer to a “normal” life expectancy. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)CLL also occurs in the bone marrow, leading to the production of too many lymphocytes, another type of white blood cell. Like CML, CLL tends to occur in middle-aged adults and is one of the most common types of adult-onset leukemia. CLL is also rare in children.Unlike CML, CLL develops slowly. Some of the symptoms include: swollen lymph nodesexcessive weakness or fatigueeasy bruising or bleedingYou may not experience symptoms until CLL reaches a later phase.Hairy cell leukemia (HCL)HCL is a rare form of CLL that causes the same symptoms as CLL. It’s called “hairy” cell because of the way the cancerous cells look under a microscope. HCL is thought to occur mostly in older men, though the exact cause isn’t known. Unlike other types of leukemia, HCL isn’t defined by stages. It’s also more difficult to treat, and may recur despite standard treatments. TreatmentsTargeted therapies are also used in early CLL cases. Research has shown that combination therapies may be more effective compared to using one targeted therapy at one time.Another potential future treatment may include the use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. This type of immunotherapy alters healthy cells in a way they may more effectively attack cancerous ones.Researchers are also investigating the possibility of additional targeted therapies to help treat HCL.Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)AML occurs when there are abnormal white blood cells in your body called myeloblasts. This type of cancer is also called acute myelogenous, granulocytic, nonlymphocytic, or myeloblastic leukemia.The most common form of acute (fast-developing) leukemia among adults, AML is also the most critical because it progresses rapidly. Some adults previously treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) as children may develop AML later in life.TreatmentsAML is most commonly treated with chemotherapy (with or without stem cells) and radiation therapy. Various targeted therapies are relatively new in the treatment of AML, and different combinations are being researched further.Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)Also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL is responsible for creating too many lymphocytes. Unlike the chronic version of this cancer (CLL), ALL rapidly progresses if it’s left untreated. However, ALL may be easier to treat than AML.Also, while CLL is more common in adults, ALL is more prevalent in children. However, certain risk factors may increase the risk of ALL in adults, such as being an adult white male over the age of 70.TreatmentsCAR T-cell therapy is currently used in children and young adults with ALL. As with CLL, research is ongoing into the possibility of using CAR T-cells for older adults with this type of cancer.What are the main treatment plans for leukemia?The exact type of treatment depends on the stage and type of leukemia you have, as well as your age. Targeted therapies are used in earlier phases of this cancer, while surgeries and stem cell transplants are used when other treatment options haven’t worked. Stem cell transplants are also more typically used in children.Unlike other types of leukemia, both CLL and HCL treatment may include watchful waiting in early stages due to the slower rates of progression.Both ALL and AML progress rapidly. Early treatment is important to help prevent further spread.How can I cope with leukemia?A leukemia diagnosis can be challenging to process for both you and your loved ones no matter which type you may have.First, learn as much as you can about your cancer diagnosis. Talk with a doctor and ask them questions about treatment options and factors that affect your prognosis, which can vary between individuals.Also, enlist the help of friends and loved ones for emotional support and assistance with daily tasks as you start cancer treatment.For additional help, ask a doctor for local or virtual leukemia support groups. Such groups consist of individuals sharing similar experiences who may seek or offer advice while also helping you feel less alone.What’s the outlook for leukemia?Overall, the exact outlook for all types of leukemia depends on: your agestage of progression of cancer cellstreatment responseAML and ALL progress the most rapidly of all subtypes.It’s estimated that 1.5 percent of all Americans will develop leukemia in their lifetime. But the overall death rate continues to decline, thanks to developing treatments. Because everyone responds to leukemia medications differently, it’s important to continue talking with a doctor about all of your options.The takeawayThe exact treatment and prognosis for leukemia depends greatly on the type due to each one’s differing effects on your blood cells. You may also need slower or more aggressive treatment depending on whether the case is chronic or acute.Having friends and loved ones help you with anything you need as well as a support group to share your experiences and learn from other can help you prepare and cope with the next steps in your journey.",https://www.healthline.com/health/leukemia/types-of-leukemia,Leukemia,What Are the Types of Leukemia?
143,"            In recent years, there has been an emphasis on harnessing the immune system for therapeutic interventions. Adoptive cell therapies (ACT) have emerged as an effective option for B-cell derived hematological malignancies. Despite remarkable successes with ACT, immune dysregulation and the leukemia microenvironment can critically alter clinical responses. Therefore, preclinical modeling can contribute to the advancement of ACT for leukemias. Human xenografts, the current mainstay of ACT in vivo models, cannot evaluate the impact of the immunosuppressive leukemia microenvironment on adoptively transferred cells. Syngeneic mouse models utilize murine tumor models and implant them into immunocompetent mice. This provides an alternative model, reducing the need for complicated breeding strategies while maintaining a matched immune system, stromal compartment, and leukemia burden. Syngeneic models that evaluate ACT have analyzed the complexity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, T cell receptor transgenics, and chimeric antigen receptors. This review examines the immunosuppressive features of the leukemia microenvironment, discusses how preclinical modeling helps predict ACT associated toxicities and dysfunction, and explores publications that have employed syngeneic modeling in ACT studies for the improvement of therapy for leukemias.

144,"          Clinical characteristics:                    Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is characterized by arterial, intestinal, and/or uterine fragility; thin, translucent skin; easy bruising; characteristic facial appearance (thin vermilion of the lips, micrognathia, narrow nose, prominent eyes); and an aged appearance to the extremities, particularly the hands. Vascular dissection or rupture, gastrointestinal perforation, or organ rupture are the presenting signs in most adults with vEDS. Arterial rupture may be preceded by aneurysm, arteriovenous fistulae, or dissection but also may occur spontaneously. The majority (60%) of individuals with vEDS who are diagnosed before age 18 years are identified because of a positive family history. Neonates may present with clubfoot, hip dislocation, limb deficiency, and/or amniotic bands. Approximately half of children tested for vEDS in the absence of a positive family history present with a major complication at an average age of 11 years. Four minor diagnostic features – distal joint hypermobility, easy bruising, thin skin, and clubfeet – are most often present in those children ascertained without a major complication.              Diagnosis/testing:                    The diagnosis of vEDS is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL3A1, or, when molecular genetic testing does not identify a COL3A1 pathogenic variant, on biochemical analysis of type III procollagen from cultured fibroblasts.              Management:        Treatment of manifestations: Affected individuals are instructed to seek immediate medical attention for sudden, unexplained pain. Treatment may include medical or surgical management for arterial complications, bowel rupture, or uterine rupture during pregnancy.    Surveillance: May include periodic arterial screening by ultrasound examination, magnetic resonance angiogram, or computed tomography angiogram with and without venous contrast. Blood pressure monitoring on a regular basis is recommended to allow for early treatment if hypertension develops.    Agents/circumstances to avoid: Trauma (collision sports, heavy lifting, and weight training with extreme lifting); arteriography should be discouraged and used only to identify life-threatening sources of bleeding prior to surgical intervention because of the risk of vascular injury; routine colonoscopy in the absence of concerning symptoms or a strong family history of colon cancer; elective surgery unless the benefit is expected to be substantial.    Evaluation of relatives at risk: The genetic status of at-risk relatives should be clarified through molecular genetic testing or clinical evaluation if the pathogenic variant is unknown.    Pregnancy management: Affected women have a 5% mortality risk with each pregnancy. The issue of management and recommendations is complicated by the recognition that many of the women who became pregnant, and their providers, learn of the diagnosis at the time of delivery and the onset of complications. When the mother’s diagnosis is known, maternal risks should be discussed and she should be followed in a high-risk obstetric program.    Other: Affected individuals should carry documentation of their genetic diagnosis, such as a MedicAlert®, emergency letter, or vEDS ""passport.""              Genetic counseling:                    Vascular EDS is almost always inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but rare examples of biallelic inheritance have been reported. About 50% of affected individuals have inherited the COL3A1 pathogenic variant from an affected parent, and about 50% of affected individuals have a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant and developing the disorder. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible in families in which the pathogenic variant in COL3A1 has been identified.

145,"            Classical EDS is a heritable disorder of connective tissue. Patients are affected with joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibilty, and skin fragility leading to atrophic scarring and significant bruising. These clinical features suggest consideration of the diagnosis which then needs to be confirmed, preferably by genetic testing. The most recent criteria for the diagnosis of EDS were devised in Villefranche in 1997. [Beighton et al. (1998); Am J Med Genet 77:31-37]. The aims set out in the Villefranche Criteria were: to enable diagnostic uniformity for clinical and research purposes, to understand the natural history of each subtype of EDS, to inform management and genetic counselling, and to identify potential areas of research. The authors recognized that the criteria would need updating, but viewed the Villefranche nosology as a good starting point. Since 1997, there have been major advances in the molecular understanding of classical EDS. Previous question marks over genetic heterogeneity have been largely surpassed by evidence that abnormalities in type V collagen are the cause. Advances in molecular testing have made it possible to identify the causative mutation in the majority of patients. This has aided the further clarification of this diagnosis. The aim of this literature review is to summarize the current knowledge and highlight areas for future research. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

146,"          Clinical characteristics:                    Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). The skin is soft and doughy to the touch, and hyperextensible, extending easily and snapping back after release (unlike lax, redundant skin, as in cutis laxa). The skin is fragile, as manifested by splitting of the dermis following relatively minor trauma, especially over pressure points (knees, elbows) and areas prone to trauma (shins, forehead, chin). Wound healing is poor, and stretching of scars after apparently successful primary wound healing is characteristic. Complications of joint hypermobility, such as dislocations of the shoulder, patella, digits, hip, radius, and clavicle, usually resolve spontaneously or are easily managed by the affected individual. Other features include hypotonia with delayed motor development, fatigue and muscle cramps, and easy bruising. Mitral valve prolapse can occur infrequently, but tends to be of little clinical consequence. Aortic root dilatation has been reported, appears to be more common in young individuals, and rarely progresses.              Diagnosis/testing:                    The diagnosis of cEDS is established in a proband with the minimal clinical diagnostic criteria (skin hyperextensibility and atrophic scarring and either GJH or ≥3 minor clinical criteria) and identification on molecular genetic testing of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL5A1, COL5A2, or (less commonly) COL1A1.              Management:        Treatment of manifestations: Children with hypotonia and delayed motor development benefit from physiotherapy. Non-weight-bearing exercise promotes muscle strength and coordination. Anti-inflammatory drugs may alleviate joint pain. Those with hypotonia, joint instability, and chronic pain may need to adapt lifestyles accordingly. Dermal wounds are closed without tension, preferably in two layers. For other wounds, deep stitches are applied generously; cutaneous stitches are left in place twice as long as usual; and the borders of adjacent skin are carefully taped to prevent stretching of the scar. DDAVP® (deamino-delta-D-arginine vasopressin) may be useful to normalize bleeding time. Cardiovascular problems are treated in a standard manner.    Prevention of primary manifestations: Young children with skin fragility can wear pads or bandages over the forehead, knees, and shins to avoid skin tears. Older children can wear soccer pads or ski stockings with shin padding during activities. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) may reduce bruising.    Surveillance: Yearly echocardiogram when aortic dilatation and/or mitral valve prolapse are present.    Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sports with heavy joint strain; acetylsalicylate (aspirin).              Genetic counseling:                    Classic EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It is estimated that approximately 50% of affected individuals have an affected parent, and approximately 50% of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

147,"          Introduction:                    Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) cause significant morbidity and premature mortality among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. RHDAustralia has produced a fully updated clinical guideline in response to new knowledge gained since the 2012 edition. The guideline aligns with major international ARF and RHD practice guidelines from the American Heart Association and World Heart Federation to ensure best practice. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality and strength of evidence where appropriate.              Main recommendations:                    The 2020 Australian guideline details best practice care for people with or at risk of ARF and RHD. It provides up-to-date guidance on primordial, primary and secondary prevention, diagnosis and management, preconception and perinatal management of women with RHD, culturally safe practice, provision of a trained and supported Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce, disease burden, RHD screening, control programs and new technologies.              Changes in management as a result of the guideline:                    Key changes include updating of ARF and RHD diagnostic criteria; change in secondary prophylaxis duration; improved pain management for intramuscular injections; and changes to antibiotic regimens for primary prevention. Other changes include an emphasis on provision of culturally appropriate care; updated burden of disease data using linked register and hospitalisations data; primordial prevention strategies to reduce streptococcal infection addressing household overcrowding and personal hygiene; recommendations for population-based echocardiographic screening for RHD in select populations; expanded management guidance for women with RHD or ARF to cover contraception, antenatal, delivery and postnatal care, and to stratify pregnancy risks according to RHD severity; and a priority classification system for presence and severity of RHD to align with appropriate timing of follow-up.

148,"            Acute rheumatic fever and its sequel rheumatic heart disease remain major unsolved problems in New Zealand, causing significant morbidity and premature death. The disease burden affects predominantly indigenous Māori and Pacific Island children and young adults. In the past decade these ethnic disparities are even widening. Secondary prophylaxis using 28-day intramuscular penicillin has been the mainstay of disease control. In the greater Auckland region, audit shows community nurse-led penicillin delivery rates of 95% and recurrence rates of less than 5%. The true penicillin failure rate of 0.07 per 100 patient years supports 4 weekly penicillin rather than more frequent dose regimens. Landmark primary prevention research has been undertaken supporting sore throat primary prevention programmes in regions with very high rheumatic fever rates. Echocardiographic screening found 2.4% previously undiagnosed rheumatic heart disease in socially disadvantaged children. Combined with secondary prevention, echocardiography screening has the potential to reduce the prevalence of severe rheumatic heart disease.

149,"            Even though incompletely understood, much of the information about the epidemiology and pathogenesis of rheumatic fever has become available only in the last few decades, a time when there have been significant fluctuations in rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in the United States. The precise roles of the bacteria, the human host, and the environment and their interrelationships require more study. Determining their roles and defining the pathogenesis can have important practical application. If one could identify a susceptible population, if one could identify the serotypes and/or strains of group A streptococci that are more dangerous (rheumatogenic) and if one could identify the reason for an abnormal immune response, vaccines might be made with specific protective components of the group A streptococci and administered only to known susceptible individuals. Providing optimal public health programs to control a disease that still is a major problem in a large segment of the world's population is the goal. It is quite clear from the resurgence of acute rheumatic fever in the United States in the mid-1980s that antibiotics alone are not the answer to rheumatic fever control. If antibiotics are not completely effective in a country such as the United States, they cannot be expected to be effective in many of the developing countries of the world where primary health care delivery is even more difficult. Intensified efforts to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the development of rheumatic fever should be undertaken. In the meantime, the preventive methods that are available should be vigorously applied.    ",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2675574/,Rheumatic Fever,Reappearance of rheumatic fever
150,"            Molecular mimicry between streptococcal and human proteins is considered as the triggering factor leading to autoimmunity in rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Here, we present a review of the genetic susceptibility markers involved in the development of RF/RHD and the major immunopathological events underlying the pathogenesis of RF and RHD. Several human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles are associated with the disease. Among these alleles, HLA-DR7 is predominantly observed in different ethnicities and is associated with the development of valvular lesions in RHD patients. Cardiac myosin is one of the major autoantigens involved in rheumatic heart lesions and several peptides from the LMM (light meromyosin) region were recognized by peripheral and intralesional T-cell clones from RF and RHD patients. The production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma from heart-infiltrating mononuclear cells suggests that Th-1 type cytokines are the mediators of RHD heart lesions while the presence of few interleukin-4 producing cells in the valve tissue contributes to the maintenance and progression of the valvular lesions.
